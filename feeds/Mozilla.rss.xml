&lt;p&gt;I did up an &lt;a href="https://evidence.dev"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; dashboard with some (hopefully) data-driven thoughts on the environmental and financial aspects of heat pump and solar technology in the Greater Toronto / Hamilton area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlach.github.io/gtha-electrification"&gt;wlach.github.io/gtha-electrification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence is pretty neat: very close to what I originally had in mind when building Irydium a few years ago at Mozilla and Recurse (see previous entries in this journal).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to type up a couple of notes about working with &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; (the python documentation generator) inside a monorepo, an issue I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with (off and on) at &lt;a href="https://voltus.co"&gt;Voltus&lt;/a&gt; since I started. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen much written about this topic despite (I suspect) it being a reasonably frequent problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about Sphinx: it&amp;rsquo;s great at handling deeply nested trees of detailed documentation with cross-references inside a version control system. It has local search that works pretty well and some themes (like &lt;a href="https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;readthedocs&lt;/a&gt;) scale pretty nicely to hundreds of documents. The directives and roles system is pretty flexible and covers most of the common things one might want to express in technical documentation. And if the built-in set of functionality isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, there&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of third party extension modules. My only major complaint is that it uses the somewhat obscure &lt;a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html"&gt;restructuredText&lt;/a&gt; file format by default, but you can get around that by using the excellent &lt;a href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;MyST extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it has a pretty deeply baked in assumption that all documentation for your project lives inside a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; subfolder. This is fine for a small repository representing a single python module, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;
README.md
setup.cfg
pyproject.toml
mymodule/
docs/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for a large monorepo, where you would typically see something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/module-1/submodule-a
&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/module-1/submodule-b
&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/module-2/submodule-c
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a monorepo, you usually want to include a module&amp;rsquo;s documentation inside its own directory. This allows you to use your &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners"&gt;code ownership constraints&lt;/a&gt; for documentation, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The naive solution would be to create a sphinx site for every single one of these submodules. This is what happened at Voltus and I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it. For a large monorepo you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with dozens, maybe hundreds of documentation &amp;ldquo;sites&amp;rdquo;. Under this scenario, discoverability becomes a huge problem: no longer can you rely on tables of contents and the built-in search to discover content: you just have to &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; where things live. I&amp;rsquo;m more than nine months in here and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; discovering new documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be much better if we could somehow collect documentation from other parts of the repository into a single site. Is this possible? tl;dr: Yes. There&amp;rsquo;s a few solutions, each with their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-obvious-solution-that-doesnt-work"&gt;The obvious solution that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious solution here is to create a symbolic link inside your documentation directory, say the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/docs/
&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/docs/module-1/submodule-a -&amp;gt; &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/module-1/submodule-a/docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10199233/can-sphinx-link-to-documents-that-are-not-located-in-directories-below-the-root"&gt;this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/a&gt;. ☹️ Sphinx doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow symbolic links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="solution-1-just-copy-the-files-in"&gt;Solution 1: Just copy the files in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious solution is to just copy the files from various parts of the monorepo into place, as part of the build system. Mozilla did this for Firefox, with the &lt;a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/tools/moztreedocs/__init__.py"&gt;moztreedocs&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/"&gt;results look pretty good&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a bespoke solution. Aside from general ideas, there&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;m going to be able to apply anything in moztreedocs to Voltus&amp;rsquo;s monorepo (which is based on a completely different build system). And being honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the 40+ hour (estimated) effort to reimplement it would be a good use of time compared to other things I could be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="solution-2-use-the-include-directive-with-myst"&gt;Solution 2: Use the include directive with MyST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later versions of MyST include support for &lt;a href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/index.html#include-a-file-from-outside-the-docs-folder-like-readme-md"&gt;directly importing a markdown file from another part of the repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a limited form of embedding: it won&amp;rsquo;t let you import an entire directory of markdown files. But if your submodules mostly just include content in the form of a &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; (or similar), it might just be enough. Just create a directory for these files to live (say &lt;code&gt;services&lt;/code&gt;) and slot them in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/docs/services/module-1/submodule-a/index.md&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{include} ../../../module-1/submodule-a/README.md
```&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of implementing this solution inside Voltus. I have optimism that this will be a big (if incremental) step up over what we have right now. There are obviously limits, but you can cram a lot of useful information in a README. As a bonus, it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty nice marker for those spelunking through the source code (much more so than a forest of tiny documentation files).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="solution-3-sphinx-collections"&gt;Solution 3: Sphinx Collections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one I just found about today: &lt;a href="https://sphinx-collections.readthedocs.io"&gt;Sphinx Collections&lt;/a&gt; is a small python module that lets you automatically import entire &lt;em&gt;directories&lt;/em&gt; of files into your sphinx tree, under a &lt;code&gt;_collections&lt;/code&gt; module. You configure it in your top-level &lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="brush: py"&gt;
 &lt;div class="colorful"&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sphinxcontrib.collections"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"submodule-a"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"driver"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"symlink"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"source"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/monorepo/module-1/submodule-a/docs"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"target"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"submodule-a"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting this up, &lt;code&gt;submodule-a&lt;/code&gt; is now available under &lt;code&gt;_collections&lt;/code&gt; and you can include it in your table of contents like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...

```{toctree}
:caption: submodule-a

_collections/submodule-a/index.md
```

...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, &lt;code&gt;submodule-a&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s documentation should be available under &lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;my doc domain&amp;gt;/_collections/submodule-a/index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty nifty. The main downside I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far is that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t play nicely with the &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/edit-source-links-sphinx.html"&gt;Edit on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; links that the readthedocs theme automatically inserts (it thinks the files exist under &lt;code&gt;_collections&lt;/code&gt;), but there&amp;rsquo;s probably a way to work around that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on investigating this approach further in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>90 days out and in</title>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;The 90 day mark just passed at my &lt;a href="https://voltus.co"&gt;new gig at Voltus&lt;/a&gt;, feels like a good time for a bit of self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I think it&amp;rsquo;s been a good change and that it was the right time to leave Mozilla. Since I left, a few people have asked me why I chose to do so: while the full answer is pretty complicated (these things are never simple!), I think it does ultimately come down to wanting to try something new after 10+ years. I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a fair amount of expertise in web development and data engineering and I wanted to see if I could apply them to a new area that I cared about&amp;mdash; in this case, climate change and the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voltus is a much younger and different company than Mozilla was, and there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of things to learn and do. Energy markets are a rather interesting technical domain to work in&amp;mdash; a big intersection between politics, technology, and business. Lots of very old and very new things all at once. As a still-relatively young company, there is definitely more of a feeling that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to shape Voltus&amp;rsquo;s culture and practices, which has been interesting. There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a balancing act between sharing what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned in previous roles while having the humility to recognize that there&amp;rsquo;s much you still don&amp;rsquo;t understand in a new workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the downside, I have to admit that I do miss being able to work in the open. &lt;a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/voltus-launches-1-3b-spac-to-help-businesses-reshape-their-power-use-and-ease-grid-stress"&gt;Voltus is currently in the process of going public&lt;/a&gt;, which has made me extra shy about saying much of anything about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in a public forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent I&amp;rsquo;ve been scratching this itch by continuing to work on &lt;a href="https://irydium.dev"&gt;Irydium&lt;/a&gt; when I have the chance. I&amp;rsquo;ve done up a few new releases in the last couple of months, which I think have been fairly well received inside my very small community of people doing like-minded things. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on attending (at least part of) a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/wiki/PyCon2022-sprint"&gt;pyodide sprint&lt;/a&gt; in early May, which I think should be a lot of fun as well as an opportunity to push browser-based data science forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also kept more of a connection with Mozilla than I thought I would have: some video meetings with former colleagues, answering questions on Element (&lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix"&gt;chat.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;), even &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glean-dictionary/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awlach+is%3Aclosed"&gt;some pull requests&lt;/a&gt; where I felt like I could make a quick contribution. I&amp;rsquo;m still using Firefox, which has actually given me more perspective on some problems that people at Mozilla might not experience (e.g. &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536777"&gt;this screensharing bug&lt;/a&gt; which you&amp;rsquo;d only see if you&amp;rsquo;re using a WebRTC-based video conferencing solution like Google Meet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure to what extent this will continue: even if the source code to Firefox and the tooling that supports it is technically &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo;, outsiders like myself really have very limited visibility into what Mozilla is doing these days. This makes it difficult to really connect with much of what&amp;rsquo;s going on or know how I might be able to contribute. While it might be theoretically possible to join Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Slack (at least last I checked), that feels like a rabbit hole I&amp;rsquo;d prefer not to go down. While I&amp;rsquo;m still interested in supporting Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s mission, I really don&amp;rsquo;t want more than one workplace chat tool in my life: there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of content there that is no longer relevant to me as a non-employee and (being honest) I&amp;rsquo;d rather leave behind. There&amp;rsquo;s lots more I could say about this, but probably best to leave it there: I understand that there&amp;rsquo;s reasons why things are the way they are, even if they make me a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>Leaving Mozilla</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to leave Mozilla as an employee: my last day will be December 31st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate the impact Mozilla has had on my life. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for all the interactions I&amp;rsquo;ve had with the community: the opportunity to build technology for the public good with people around the world was unique and I&amp;rsquo;m really going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back over the &lt;a href="/blog/2021/07/10-years-at-mozilla/"&gt;past 10 years&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty good about the impact I had through building better developer and data tooling: &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide"&gt;Iodide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;Glean Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; stand out as particular highlights. Thanks to everyone who worked on those things with me! I am because we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="last-lecture"&gt;Last Lecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s become traditional in &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Data"&gt;Data @ Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; for the person leaving to give a last lecture on their way out. I decided to give a talk on a specific area of focus for me over the last couple of years: &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5j6BoxZ-7w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how comprehensible it will be to people outside of my particular context at Mozilla, but it seemed fitting to post it publically regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m more convinced than ever that documentation is one of the keys to empowering people to make better decisions with data (no matter what their job title). I hope my efforts here have been helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="joining-the-community"&gt;Joining the Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having spent a good chunk of energy on making it possible for people outside the Mozilla Corporation to contribute to our projects, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what it&amp;rsquo;s like on the other side of the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure right now exactly how active I&amp;rsquo;ll be, but I plan on sticking around on Matrix and Bugzilla, at least a little bit. If there&amp;rsquo;s anything I can help you with, feel free to reach out!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>Learning about Psychological Safety at the Recurse Center</title>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I took a 6-week sabbatical from my job to attend a virtual “programmers retreat” at the &lt;a href="https://recurse.com"&gt;Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up some notes on the experience, with a particular lens towards what makes an environment suited towards learning, innovation, and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some context: I’m currently working as a software engineer at Mozilla, building out our data pipeline and analysis tooling. I&amp;rsquo;ve been at my current position for more than 10 years (my &amp;ldquo;anniversary&amp;rdquo; actually passed while I was out). I started out as a senior engineer in 2011, and was promoted to staff engineer in 2016. In tech-land, this is a really long tenure at a company. I felt like it was time to take a break from my day-to-day, explore some new ideas and concepts, and hopefully expose myself to a broader group of people in my field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original thinking was that I would mostly be spending this time building out an interactive computation environment I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on called &lt;a href="https://irydium.dev"&gt;Irydium&lt;/a&gt;. And I did quite a bit of that. However, I think the main thing I took away from this experience was some insight on what makes a remote environment for knowledge work really “click”. In particular, what makes somewhere feel psychologically safe, and how this feeling allows us to innovate and do our best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Recurse Center obviously has different goals than an organization that builds and delivers consumer software, I do think there are some things that it does that could be applied to Mozilla (and, likely, many other tech workplaces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-recurse-center"&gt;What is the Recurse Center?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most succinctly, the Recurse Center is a &amp;ldquo;writer&amp;rsquo;s retreat for programmers&amp;rdquo;. It tries to provide an environment conducive to learning and creativity, an opportunity to refine your craft and learn new things, both from the act of programming itself &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; from interactions with the other like-minded people attending. The Recurse Center admits a wide variety of people, from those who have only been through a coding bootcamp to those who have been in the industry many years, like myself. The main admission criteria, from what I gather, are curiosity and friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once admitted, you do a &amp;ldquo;batch&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; either a mini (1 week), half-batch (6 weeks), or a full batch (12 weeks). I did a half-batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-does-it-work-during-a-global-pandemic"&gt;How does it work (during a global pandemic)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recurse experience used to be entirely in-person, in a space in New York City - if you wanted to go, you needed to move there at least temporarily. Obviously that&amp;rsquo;s out the window during a Global Pandemic, and all activities are currently happening online. This was actually pretty ideal for me at this point in my life, as it allowed me to participate entirely remotely from my home in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a few elements that make &amp;ldquo;Virtual RC&amp;rdquo; tick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A virtual space (pictured below) where you can see other people in your cohort. This is particularly useful when you want to jump into a conference room.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A shared &amp;ldquo;calendar&amp;rdquo; where people can schedule events, either adhoc (e.g. a one off social event, discussing a paper) or on a regular basis (e.g. a reading group)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A zulip chat server (which is a bit like Slack) for adhoc conversation with people in your cohort and alumni. There are multiple channels, covering a broad spectrum of interests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2021/10/virtual_RC.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-work"&gt;Why does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, what I&amp;rsquo;ve described probably sounds a lot like any remote tech workplace during the pandemic&amp;hellip; and it sort of is! In some ways, my schedule and life while at Recurse didn&amp;rsquo;t feel all that different from my normal day-to-day. Wake up in the morning, drink coffee, meditate, work for roughly 8 hours, done. Qualitatively, however, my experience at Recurse felt unusually productive, and I learned a lot more than I expected to: not just the core stuff related to Irydium, but also unexpected new concepts like CRDTs, product design, and even &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/issues/152"&gt;how visual studio code syntax highlighting works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made the difference? Certainly, not having the normal pressures of a workplace helps - but I think there&amp;rsquo;s more to it than that. The way RC is constructed reinforces a sense of &lt;em&gt;psychological safety&lt;/em&gt; which I think is key to learning and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-psychological-safety-and-why-should-i-care"&gt;What is psychological safety and why should I care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological safety is a bit of a hot topic these days and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of discussion about in management circles. I think it comes down to a feeling that you can take risks and &amp;ldquo;put yourself out there&amp;rdquo; without fear that you&amp;rsquo;ll be ignored, attacked, or ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? I would argue, because knowledge work is about building understanding &amp;mdash; going from a place of not understanding to understanding. If you’re working on anything at all innovative, there is always an element of the unknown. In my experience, there is virtually always a sense of discomfort and uncertainty that goes along with that. This goes double when you&amp;rsquo;re working around and with people that you don&amp;rsquo;t know terribly well (and who might have far more experience than you). Are they going to make fun of you for not knowing a basic concept or for expressing an idea that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;so wrong I don’t even know where to begin&amp;rdquo;? Or, just as bad, will you not get any feedback on your work at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, except in truly toxic environments, you&amp;rsquo;ll rarely encounter outright abusive behaviour. But the isolation of remote work can breed similar feelings of disquiet and discomfort over time. My sense, after a year of working &amp;ldquo;hardcore&amp;rdquo; remote in COVID times, is that our normal workplace rituals of meetings, “stand ups”, and discussions over Slack don&amp;rsquo;t provide enough space for a meaningful sense of psychological safety to develop. They’re good enough for measuring progress towards agreed-upon goals but a true sense of belonging depends on less tightly scripted interactions among peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-the-recurse-environment-creates-psychological-safety"&gt;How the Recurse environment creates psychological safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the environment I described above isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different from a workplace, is it? Speaking from my own experience, my coworkers at Mozilla are all pretty nice people. There’s also many channels for informal discussion at Mozilla, and of course direct messaging is always available (via Slack or Matrix). And yet, I still feel there is a pretty large gap between the two experiences. So what makes the difference? I&amp;rsquo;d say there were three important aspects of Recurse that really helped here: social rules, gentle prompts, and a closed space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="social-rules"&gt;Social rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of discussion about community participation guidelines and standards of behaviour in workplaces. In general, these types of policies target really egregious behaviour like harassment: this is a pretty low bar. They aren&amp;rsquo;t, in my experience, sufficient to actually create an environment that actually feels safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recurse Center goes over and above a basic code of conduct, with four simple social rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;No well-actually’s: corrections that aren’t relevant to the point someone was trying to make (this is probably the rule we’re most heavily conditioned to break).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;No feigned surprise: acting surprised when someone doesn’t know something.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;No backseat driving: lobbing advice from across the room (or across the online chat) without really joining or engaging in a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;No subtle -isms: subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;commandments&amp;rdquo; and you&amp;rsquo;re not meant to feel shame for violating them. The important thing is that by being there, the rules create an &lt;em&gt;environment conducive to learning and growth&lt;/em&gt;. You can be reasonably confident that you can bring up a question or discussion point (or respond to one) and it won&amp;rsquo;t lead to a bad outcome. For example, you can expect not to be made fun of for asking what a UNIX socket is (and if you are, you can tell the person doing so to stop). Rather than there being an unspoken rule that everyone should already know everything about what they are trying to do, there is a spoken rule that states it’s expected that they don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on Irydium, there&amp;rsquo;s an infinite number of ways I can feel incompetent: this is a requirement when engaging with concepts that I still don&amp;rsquo;t feel completely comfortable with: parsers, compilers, WebAssembly&amp;hellip; the list goes on. Knowing that I could talk about what I&amp;rsquo;m working on (or something I&amp;rsquo;m interested in) and that the responses I got would be constructive and directed to the project, not the person made all the difference.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2021-10-19-learning-about-psychological-safety-at-the-recurse-centre-footnote-1-definition" name="2021-10-19-learning-about-psychological-safety-at-the-recurse-centre-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="gentle-prompts"&gt;Gentle prompts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I loved the most about Recurse were the gentle prompts to engage with other people, talk about your work, and get help. A few that I really enjoyed during my time there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;checkins&amp;rdquo; channel. People would post what&amp;rsquo;s going on with their time at RC, their challenges, their struggles. Often there would be little snippits about people&amp;rsquo;s lives in there, which built to a feeling of community.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Hack &amp;amp; Tell: A weekly event where a group of us would get together in a Zoom room, talk about working on or building something, then rejoin the chat an hour later to show off what we accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Coffee Chats: A &amp;ldquo;coffee chat&amp;rdquo; bot at RC would pair you with other people in your batch (or alumni) on a cadence of your choosing. I met so many great people this way!&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Weekly Presentations: At the end of each week, people would sign up to share something that they were working on our learned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and I could go on. What&amp;rsquo;s important are not the specific activities, but their end effect of building connectedness, creating opportunities for serendipitous collaboration and interaction (more than one discussion group came out of someone&amp;rsquo;s checkin post on Zulip) and generally creating an environment well-suited to learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-semi-closed-space"&gt;A (semi) closed space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that makes the gentle prompts above &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; is that you have some idea of who you&amp;rsquo;re going to be interacting with. Having some predictability about who&amp;rsquo;s going to see what you post and engage with you (that they were vetted by RC&amp;rsquo;s interview process and are committed to the above-mentioned social rules) gives you some confidence to be vulnerable and share things that you might be reluctant to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have known me for a while will probably see the above as being a bit of departure from what I normally preach: throughout my tenure at Mozilla, I’ve constantly pushed the people I’ve worked with to do more work in public. In the case of a product like Firefox, which touches so many people, I think open and transparent practices are absolutely essential to building trust, creating opportunity, and ensuring that our software reflects a diversity of views. I applied the same philosophy to Irydium’s development while I was at the Recurse Center: I set up a public Matrix channel to discuss the project, published all my work on GitHub, and was quite chatty about what I was working on, both in this blog and on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key, I think, is being deliberate about what approach you take when: there is a place for both public and private conversations about what we work on. I’m strongly in favour of open design documents, community calls, public bug trackers and open source in general. But I think it’s also pretty ok to have smaller spaces for learning, personal development, and question asking. I know I strongly appreciated having a smaller group of people that I could talk to about ideas that were not yet fully formed: you can always bring them out into the open later. The psychological risk of working in public can be mitigated by the psychological safety that can be developed within an intentional community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bringing-it-back"&gt;Bringing it back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to my job, I wondered if it might be possible to bring some of what I described above back to Mozilla? Obviously not everything would be directly transferable: Mozilla has its own mission and goals, and there are pressures that exist in a workplace that do not exist in an environment purely directed at learning. Still, I suspected that there was something we could do here. And that it would be worth doing, not just to improve the felt experience of the people here (though that would be reason enough) but also to get more feedback on our work and create more opportunities for collaboration and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like trying to do something inside our particular organization (Data Engineering and Data Science) would be the most tractable initial step. I talked a bit about my experience with &lt;a href="https://bluesock.org/~willkg/"&gt;Will Kahn-Green&lt;/a&gt; (who has been at Mozilla around the same length of time as I have) and we came up with what we called the “Data Neighbourhood” project: a set of grassroots micro-initiatives to increase our connectedness as a group. As an organization directed primarily at serving other parts of Mozilla, most of our team’s communication is directed outward. It’s often hard to know what everyone else is up to, where they’re struggling, and how we could help each other out. Attacking that problem directly seemed like the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first experiment we tried was a “data checkins” channel on Slack, a place for people to talk informally about their work (or life!). I explicitly set it up with a similar set of social rules as outlined above and tried to emphasize that it was a place to talk about how things are going, rather than a place to report status to your manager. After a somewhat slow start (the initial posts were from Will, myself, and a few other people from Data Engineering who had been around for a long time) we’re beginning to see engagement from others, including some newer people I hadn’t interacted with much before. There’s also been a few useful threads of conversations across different sub-teams (for example, a discussion on how we identify distinct versions of Firefox for iOS) that likely would not have happened without the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, others have tried a few other things in the same vein (an adhoc coffee chat pairing bot, a “writing help” channel) and there are some signs of success. There’s clearly an appetite for new and better ways for us to relate to each other about the work we’re doing, and I’m excited to see how these ideas evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect there are limits to how psychologically safe a workplace can ever feel (and some of that is probably outside of any individual’s control). There are dynamics in a workplace which make applying some of Recurse’s practices difficult. In particular, a posture of “not knowing things is o.k.” may not apply perfectly to a workplace where people are hired (and promoted) based on perceived competence and expertise. Still, I think it’s worth investigating what might be possible within the constraints of the system we’re in. There are big potential benefits, for our creative output and our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many thanks to Jenny Zhang, Kathleen Beckett, Joe Trellick, Taylor Phebillo and Vaibhav Sagar, and Will Kahn-Greene for reviewing earlier drafts of this post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;Getting back into the swing of things at Mozilla after my extended break. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on enhancing and extending &lt;a href="https://looker.com/"&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt; support for Glean-based applications, which eventually led me back to working on &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/bigquery-etl/"&gt;bigquery-etl&lt;/a&gt;, our framework for creating derived datasets in our data lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time working on improving the initial developer experience of bigquery-etl early this year, so I figured it would be no problem to get going again despite an extended hiatus from it (I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably been ~2&amp;ndash;3 months since I last touched it). Unfortunately the first thing I got after creating a fresh virtual environment (to pick up the new dependency updates) was this exciting looking error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wlach@antwerp bigquery-etl % ./bqetl --help
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  File "/Users/wlach/src/bigquery-etl/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/google/cloud/bigquery_v2/types/__init__.py", line 16, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
    from .encryption_config import EncryptionConfiguration
  File "/Users/wlach/src/bigquery-etl/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/google/cloud/bigquery_v2/types/encryption_config.py", line 26, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
    class EncryptionConfiguration(proto.Message):
  File "/Users/wlach/src/bigquery-etl/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/proto/message.py", line 200, in __new__

  File "/Users/wlach/src/bigquery-etl/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/proto/_file_info.py", line 42, in maybe_add_descriptor
    descriptor=descriptor_pb2.FileDescriptorProto(
TypeError: descriptor to field 'google.protobuf.FileDescriptorProto.name' doesn't apply to 'FileDescriptorProto' object&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-i-did"&gt;What I did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we have pretty decent continuous integration at Mozilla, when I see an error like this I am usually pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of strange interaction between my local development environment and whatever dependencies we&amp;rsquo;ve specified for the repository in question. Usually these problems are pretty easy to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I tried was to type the error into Google, to see if this had come up for anyone else before. I tried several variations of &lt;code&gt;TypeError: descriptor to field&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FileDescriptorProto&lt;/code&gt; and nothing really turned up. This strategy almost always turns up &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. When it doesn&amp;rsquo;t it usually indicates that something pretty strange is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see if this was a strange problem particular to &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, I asked on our internal channel but no one had offhand seen or heard of this error either. One of my colleagues (who had a working setup on a Mac, the same environment I was using) suggested I set up &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"&gt;pyenv&lt;/a&gt; to isolate my development environment, which was a good idea but did not seem to solve the problem: both Python 3.8 and 3.9 installed via pyenv ran into the exact same issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After flailing around trying a number of other failed approaches (maybe I need to upgrade the version of virtualenv that we&amp;rsquo;re using?), I broke down and looked harder at the error itself. It seemed to be some kind of typing error in Google&amp;rsquo;s protobuf library, which google-cloud-bigquery is calling. If this sort of thing was happening to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, we probably would have seen it happening more broadly. So my guess, again, was that it was happening due to an obscure interaction between some variable on my machine and this particular combination of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I systematically went through our set of python dependencies to see what might be the matter. For the most part, I found nothing surprising or suspicious. &lt;code&gt;google-api-core&lt;/code&gt; was at the latest version, as was &lt;code&gt;google-cloud-bigquery&lt;/code&gt;. However, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; notice that the version of &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/"&gt;protobuf&lt;/a&gt; we were using was a little older (3.15.8 when the latest &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; version on pypi was 3.17.3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2021/08/pypi-screenshot.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like a longshot that the problem was there, but it seemed like upgrading the dependency was worth a try just in case. So I bumped the version of protobuf to the latest version in my local checkout (&lt;code&gt;pip install protobuf==3.17.3&lt;/code&gt;)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and sure enough, after doing so, the problem was fixed and &lt;code&gt;./bqetl --help&lt;/code&gt; started working again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wlach@antwerp bigquery-etl % ./bqetl --help
Usage: bqetl [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  CLI tools for working with bigquery-etl.

...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing so, I did up a quick &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/pull/2266"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; and the problem is now fixed, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit unfortunate that &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/about-dependabot-version-updates"&gt;dependabot&lt;/a&gt; (which we have configured for this repository) didn&amp;rsquo;t send an update for protobuf, which would have fixed this problem earlier.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2021-08-16-python-dependency-gotchas-always-go-to-the-source-footnote-1-definition" name="2021-08-16-python-dependency-gotchas-always-go-to-the-source-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It seems like it&amp;rsquo;s not completely reliable for python packages, for whatever reason: I have also noticed this problem with &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; (though can&amp;rsquo;t confirm) that the problem here is a backwards-incompatible change made to either &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; or one of the packages that uses it. However, the nature of the incompatibility seems subtle: bigquery-etl works fine with the old set of dependencies we run in continuous integration and it appears to only come up in specific circumstances (i.e. mine). Unfortunately, I need to get back to what I was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; planning to work on and don&amp;rsquo;t have time to unwind the rather set of complex interactions going on here. Maybe later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-i-would-have-done-differently"&gt;What I would have done differently&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of illustrates (again) to me that while some shortcuts and heuristics can save a bunch of time and mental effort (Googling things all the time is basically standard practice in the industry at this point), sometimes you really just need to start a little closer at the problem to find a solution. I was hesitant to do this in this case because I&amp;rsquo;m never sure where those kinds of rabbit holes are going to take me (e.g. I &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-airflow/issues/844"&gt;spent several days&lt;/a&gt; debugging a bad interaction between Kubernetes and our airflow cluster in late 2019 with not much to show for the effort), but often all it takes is understanding the general shape of the problem to move you to a quick solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-lessons"&gt;Other lessons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of other things this experience reinforced for me (these are more subjective, take them or leave them):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Local development environments are kind of a waste of time. The above work took me several hours and it&amp;rsquo;s going to result in ~zero user-visible improvements for anyone outside of Mozilla Data Engineering. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the potential productivity improvements that might come from using tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces"&gt;GitHub Codespaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;While I can&amp;rsquo;t confirm this was the source of the problem in this particular case, in general backwards compatibility &lt;em&gt;on every level&lt;/em&gt; is super important when your software has broad reach and doubly so if it&amp;rsquo;s a widely-used dependency of other software (and is thus hard to reason about in isolation). In these cases, what seems like a trivial change (e.g. improving the type signatures inside a Python library) can squander many hours of people&amp;rsquo;s time if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful. Backwards-incompatible changes, however innocuous they may seem, should always invoke &lt;a href="https://semver.org/"&gt;a major version bump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Likewise, bugs in software that have broad usage (like dependabot) can have big downstream impacts. If dependabot&amp;rsquo;s version bumping for python was more reliable, we likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had this problem. The glass-half-full interpretation of this is that fixing these types of issues would have an outsized benefit for the commons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li id="2021-08-16-python-dependency-gotchas-always-go-to-the-source-footnote-1-definition" class="footnote-definition"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As an aside, the main reason we use dependabot and aggressively update packages like &lt;code&gt;google-api-core&lt;/code&gt; is due to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9644"&gt;bug in pip&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#2021-08-16-python-dependency-gotchas-always-go-to-the-source-footnote-1-return"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday (July 11, 2021) was the 10 year anniversary of starting at the Mozilla Corporation. My life has changed a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; in those years: in that time I ended a marriage, changed the city in which I live two times, and took up religion&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2021-07-12-10-years-at-mozilla-footnote-1-definition" name="2021-07-12-10-years-at-mozilla-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Mozilla has also changed pretty drastically in my time here, &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/"&gt;especially in the last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet somehow I&amp;rsquo;m still at it, for more or less for the same reasons that led me to accept my initial offer to join the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity"&gt;A-team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2021-07-12-10-years-at-mozilla-footnote-2-definition" name="2021-07-12-10-years-at-mozilla-footnote-2-return"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Internet has the immense potential to be a force for individual empowerment and yet more than ever, we see this technology used to consolidate unchecked power, spread misinformation, and generally exploit people. Mozilla is not perfect (no organization is: 10 years anywhere will teach you that), but it&amp;rsquo;s one of the few remaining counter-forces to these accelerating trends. While I&amp;rsquo;m currently taking a bit of a break to &lt;a href="https://wrla.ch/blog/2021/06/mini-sabbatical-and-introducing-irydium/"&gt;explore some stuff on my own&lt;/a&gt;, I am looking forward to getting back to work on &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/about/manifesto/"&gt;the mission&lt;/a&gt; when I return in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching my 10-year moz-iversary in July, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a bit of a mini-sabbatical: I&amp;rsquo;ll be out (and trying as hard as possible not to check bugmail) from Friday, June 25th until August 9th. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a batch at the &lt;a href="https://recurse.com"&gt;Recurse Centre&lt;/a&gt; (something like a writer&amp;rsquo;s retreat for programmers), exploring some of my interests around data visualization and analysis that don&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into my role as a Data Engineer here at Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to work a bunch on a project tentatively called &amp;ldquo;Irydium&amp;rdquo;, which pursues some of the ideas I &lt;a href="https://wrla.ch/blog/2020/11/iodide-retrospective/"&gt;sketched out last year in my Iodide retrospective&lt;/a&gt; and a few more besides. I&amp;rsquo;ve been steadily working on it in my off hours, but it&amp;rsquo;s become clear that some of the things I want to pursue would benefit from more dedicated attention and the broader perspective that I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the Recurse community will be able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2021/06/irydium.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had meant to write up a proper blog post to announce the project before I left, but it looks like I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much out of time. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll just offer up the examples on the newly-minted &lt;a href="https://irydium.dev"&gt;irydium.dev&lt;/a&gt; and invite people to contact me if any of the ideas on the site sounds interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to blog a whole bunch while I&amp;rsquo;m there, but probably not under the Mozilla tag. Feel free to add wrla.ch to your RSS feed if you want to follow what I&amp;rsquo;m up to!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2021/06/02/this-week-in-glean-glean-dictionary-updates/"&gt;this is a cross-post from the data blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of progress on the Glean Dictionary since I made the initial release announcement a couple of months ago. For those coming in late, the Glean Dictionary is intended to be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary"&gt;data dictionary&lt;/a&gt; for applications built using the &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean"&gt;Glean SDK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/"&gt;Glean.js&lt;/a&gt;. This currently includes Firefox for Android and Firefox iOS, as well as newer initiatives like &lt;a href="https://rally.mozilla.org"&gt;Rally&lt;/a&gt;. Desktop Firefox &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use Glean in the future, see &lt;a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/glean/index.html"&gt;Firefox on Glean (FoG)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="production-url"&gt;Production URL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in production! You can now access the Glean Dictionary at &lt;a href="https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;. The old protosaur-based URL will redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="glean-dictionary--looker--"&gt;Glean Dictionary + Looker = ❤️&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, Mozilla chose &lt;a href="https://looker.com"&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt; as our internal business intelligence tool. Frank Bertsch, Daniel Thorn, Anthony Miyaguchi and others have been building out first class support for Glean applications inside this platform, and we&amp;rsquo;re starting to see these efforts bear fruit. Looker&amp;rsquo;s explores are far easier to use for basic data questions, opening up data based inquiry to a much larger cross section of Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recorded a quick example of this integration here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B635wgZy7Iw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Looker access is restricted to Mozilla employees and NDA&amp;rsquo;d volunteers. Stay tuned for &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/public_data.html"&gt;more public data&lt;/a&gt; to be indexed inside the Glean Dictionary in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="glean-annotations"&gt;Glean annotations!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did up the first cut of a GitHub-based system for adding annotations to metrics &amp;mdash; acting as a knowledge base for things data scientists and others have discovered about Glean Telemetry in the field. This can be &lt;em&gt;invaluable&lt;/em&gt; when doing new analysis. A good example of this is the annotation added for the &lt;a href="https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org/apps/firefox_ios/metrics/app_opened_as_default_browser"&gt;opened as default browser&lt;/a&gt; metric for Firefox for iOS, which has several gotchas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2021/06/annotations-example.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Krupa Raj and Leif Oines for producing the requirements which led up to this implementation, as well as their evangelism of this work more generally inside Mozilla. Last month, Leif and I did a presentation about this at Data Club, which has been syndicated onto YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGjrXhXNRq8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve had a very successful working session with some people Data Science and have started to fill out an initial set of annotations. You can see the progress in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glean-annotations"&gt;glean-annotations&lt;/a&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-improvements"&gt;Other Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots more miscellaneous improvements and fixes have gone into the Glean Dictionary in the last several months: see our &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glean-dictionary/releases"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; for a full list. One thing that irrationally pleases me are the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glean-dictionary/pull/626"&gt;new labels Linh Nguyen added last week&lt;/a&gt;: colorful and lively, they make it easy to see when a Glean Metric is coming from a library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2021/06/labels-example.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="future-work"&gt;Future work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Glean Dictionary is just getting started! In the next couple of weeks, we&amp;rsquo;re hoping to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Expand the Looker integration outlined above, as our deploy takes more shape.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Work on adding &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; classification to the Glean Dictionary, to make it easier for product managers and other non-engineering types to quickly find the metrics and other information they need without needing to fully understand what&amp;rsquo;s in the source tree.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Continue to refine the user interface of the Glean Dictionary as we get more feedback from people using it across Mozilla.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in getting involved, join us! The Glean Dictionary is developed in the open using cutting edge front-end technologies like &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev"&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt;. Our conviction is that being transparent about the data Mozilla collects helps us build trust with our users and the community. We&amp;rsquo;re a friendly group and hang out on the &lt;a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#glean-dictionary:mozilla.org"&gt;#glean-dictionary channel&lt;/a&gt; on Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>mozregression update May 2021</title>
   <link>https://wrla.ch/blog/2021/05/mozregression-update-may-2021/?utm_source=Mozilla&amp;utm_medium=RSS</link>

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to give some quick updates on the state of &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="anti-virus-false-positives"&gt;Anti-virus false positives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the persistent issues with mozregression is that it seems to be &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1647533"&gt;persistently detected as a virus by many popular anti-virus scanners&lt;/a&gt;. The causes for this are somewhat complex, but at root the problem is that mozregression requires fairly broad permissions to do the things it needs to do (install and run copies of Firefox) and thus its behavior is hard to distinguish from a piece of software doing something malicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently there have been a number of mitigations which seem to be improving this situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;:bryce has been submitting copies of mozregression to Microsoft so that Windows Defender (probably the most popular anti-virus software on this platform) doesn&amp;rsquo;t flag it.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I recently &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/releases"&gt;released mozregression 4.0.17&lt;/a&gt;, which upgrades the GUI dependency for pyinstaller to a later version which sets PE checksums correctly on the generated executable (&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/5579"&gt;pyinstaller/pyinstaller#5579&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to lament the fact that this is happening, but in a way I can understand it&amp;rsquo;s hard to reliably detect what kind of software is legitimate and what isn&amp;rsquo;t. I take the responsibility for distributing this kind of software seriously, and have pretty strict limits on who has access to the mozregression GitHub repository and what pull requests I&amp;rsquo;ll merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ci-ported-to-github-actions"&gt;CI ported to GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to changes in Travis&amp;rsquo;s policies, we needed to migrate continuous integration for mozregression to GitHub actions. You can see the gory details in &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1686039"&gt;bug 1686039&lt;/a&gt;. One possibly interesting wrinkle to others: due to Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s security policy, we can&amp;rsquo;t use (most) external actions inside our GitHub repository. I thus rewrote the logic for uploading a mozregression release to GitHub for MacOS and Linux GUI builds (Windows builds are still happening via &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/"&gt;AppVeyor&lt;/a&gt; for now) &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/495ef37e701709dce3a4b76ea67ec5b1f26043be/.github/workflows/build.yml#L86"&gt;from scratch&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to check the above out if you have a similar need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="macos-big-sur"&gt;MacOS Big Sur&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of version 4.0.17, the mozregression GUI now works on MacOS Big Sur. It is safe to ask community members to install and use it on this platform (though &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/install.html#mozregression-gui"&gt;note the caveats&lt;/a&gt; due to the bundle being unsigned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="usage-dashboard"&gt;Usage Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fulfilling a promise I implied last year, I created a &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/public_data.html"&gt;public dataset&lt;/a&gt; for mozregression and created an &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@wlach/mozregression-public-usage-dashboard"&gt;dashboard tracking mozregression use&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/"&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few interesting insights and trends there that can be gleaned from our telemetry. I&amp;rsquo;d be curious if the community can find any more!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>Blog moving back to wrla.ch</title>

&lt;p&gt;House keeping news: I&amp;rsquo;m moving this blog back to the &lt;a href="https://wrla.ch"&gt;wrla.ch&lt;/a&gt; domain from wlach.github.io. This domain sorta kinda worked before (I set up a &lt;a href="https://netlify.com"&gt;netlify&lt;/a&gt; deploy a couple years ago), but the software used to generate this blog referenced github all over the place in its output, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t really work as you&amp;rsquo;d expect. Anyway, this will be the last entry published on wlach.github.io: my plan is to turn that domain into a set of redirects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many of you are out there who still use RSS, but if you do, please update your feeds. I have filed a bug to update my Planet Mozilla entry, so hopefully the change there will be seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Recent events have made me not want to tie my public web presence to a particular company (especially a larger one, like Microsoft). I don&amp;rsquo;t have any immediate plans to move this blog off of github, but this gives me that option in the future. For those wondering, the original rationale for moving &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; github is in &lt;a href="/blog/2016/01/new-year-new-blog/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. Looking back, the idea of moving away from a VPS and WordPress made sense, the move away from my own domain less so. I think it may have been harder to set up static hosting (esp. with HTTPS) at that time&amp;hellip; or I might have just been ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In related news, I decided to reactivate my twitter account: you can once again find me there as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wrlach"&gt;@wrlach&lt;/a&gt; (my old username got taken in my absence). I&amp;rsquo;m not totally thrilled about this (I basically stand by what I wrote a &lt;a href="/blog/2018/01/quitting-twitter/"&gt;few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, except maybe the concession I made to Facebook being &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo;), but Twitter seems to be where my industry peers are. As someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a large organic following, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to really value forums where I can share my work. That said, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be very selective about what I engage with on that site: I appreciate your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>Community @ Mozilla: People First, Open Source Second</title>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s coming up on ten years at Mozilla for me, by far the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve held any job personally and exceedingly long by the standards of the technology industry. When I joined up in Summer 2011 to work on &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity"&gt;Engineering Productivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2021-02-24-community-mozilla-people-first-open-source-second-footnote-1-definition" name="2021-02-24-community-mozilla-people-first-open-source-second-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I really did see it as a dream job: I&amp;rsquo;d be paid to work full time on free software, which (along with open data and governance) I genuinely saw as one of the best hopes for the future. I was somewhat less sure about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo;: the notion of protecting the &amp;ldquo;open web&amp;rdquo; felt nebulous and ill-defined and the &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; seemed vague when it departed from the practical aspects of shipping a useful open source product to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems ridiculously naive in retrospect, but I can remember thinking at the time that the right amount of &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo; would solve all the problems. What can I say? It was the era of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring"&gt;Arab Spring&lt;/a&gt;, WikiLeaks had not yet become a scandal, Google still felt like something of a benevolent upstart, even Facebook&amp;rsquo;s mission of &amp;ldquo;making the world more connected&amp;rdquo; sounded great to me at the time. If we could just push more things out in the open, then the right solutions would become apparent and fixing the structural problems society was facing would become easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a difference a decade makes. The events of the last few years have demonstrated (conclusively, in my view) that open systems aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a protector against abuse by governments, technology monopolies and ill-intentioned groups of individuals alike. Amazon, Google and Facebook are (still) some of the top contributors to key pieces of open source infrastructure but it&amp;rsquo;s now beyond any doubt that they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; responsible for amplifying a very large share of the problems global society is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some of the darker sides of open source software development have become harder and harder to ignore. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Harassment and micro aggressions inside open source communities is rampant: aggressive behaviour in issue trackers, personal attacks on discussion forums, the list goes on. Women and non-binary people are disproportionately affected, although this behaviour exacts a psychological toll on everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Open source software as exploitation: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of contributors while at Mozilla. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to estimate this accurately, but based on some back-of-the-envelope calculations, I&amp;rsquo;d estimate that the efforts of community volunteers on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in have added up to (conservatively) to hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars in labour which has never been directly compensated monetarily. Based on this experience (as well as what I&amp;rsquo;ve observed elsewhere), I&amp;rsquo;d argue that Mozilla as a whole could not actually &lt;em&gt;survive&lt;/em&gt; on a sustained basis without unpaid work, which (at least on its face) seems highly problematic and creates a lingering feeling of guilt given how much I&amp;rsquo;ve benefited financially from my time here.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a road to burnout. Properly managing and nurturing an open source community is deeply complex work, involving a sustained amount of both attention and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor"&gt;emotional labour&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; this is difficult &lt;a href="https://noidea.dog/glue"&gt;glue work&lt;/a&gt; that is not always recognized or supported by peers or management. Many of the people I&amp;rsquo;ve met over the years (community volunteers and Mozilla employees alike) have ended up feeling like it just isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the effort and have either stopped doing it or have outright left Mozilla. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for an intensive meditation practice which I established around the time I started working here, I suspect I would have been in this category by now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this has led to a personal crisis of faith. Do openness and transparency inherently lead to bad outcomes? Should I continue to advocate for it in my position? As I mentioned above, the opportunity to work in the open with the community is the main thing that brought me to Mozilla&amp;mdash; if I can&amp;rsquo;t find a way of incorporating this viewpoint into my work, what am I even doing here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to answer these questions, I went back to the manifesto that I just skimmed over in my early days. Besides openness &amp;mdash; what are Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s values, really, and do I identify with them? Immediately I was struck by how much it felt like it was written &lt;em&gt;explicitly for&lt;/em&gt; the present moment (even aside from the &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/29/mozilla-marks-20th-anniversary-commitment-better-human-experiences-online/"&gt;addendums&lt;/a&gt; which were added in 2018). Many points seem to confront problems we&amp;rsquo;re grappling with now which I was only beginning to perceive ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there was also something that resonated with me on a deeper level. There were a few points, highlighted in bold, that really stood out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet must enrich the lives of individual human beings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals’ security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on the internet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The effectiveness of the internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Free and open source software promotes the development of the internet as a public resource.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial involvement in the development of the internet brings many benefits; a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth digging beneath the surface of these points: what is the underlying value system behind them? I&amp;rsquo;d argue it&amp;rsquo;s this, simply put: &lt;em&gt;human beings really do matter&lt;/em&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re not just line items in a spreadsheet or some other resource to be optimized. They are an end in of themselves. &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; (more so than a software development methodology) are the reason why I show up every day to do the work that I do. This is really an absolute which has enduring weight: it&amp;rsquo;s a foundational truth of every major world religion to say nothing of modern social democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does working and building in then open mean then? As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen above, it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t something I&amp;rsquo;d consider &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; all by itself. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt; which (if we&amp;rsquo;re going to follow it) should &lt;em&gt;come out&lt;/em&gt; of that underlying recognition of the worth of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s employees, community members, and users. Every single one of these people matter, deeply. I&amp;rsquo;d argue then, that Mozilla should consider the following factors in terms of how we work in the open:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Are our spaces&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2021-02-24-community-mozilla-people-first-open-source-second-footnote-2-definition" name="2021-02-24-community-mozilla-people-first-open-source-second-footnote-2-return"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; generally safe for people of all backgrounds to be their authentic selves? This not only means free from sexual harassment and racial discrimination, but also that they&amp;rsquo;re able to work to their full potential. This means creating opportunities for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="/blog/2018/11/making-contribution-work-for-firefox-tooling-and-data-projects/"&gt;climb the contribution curve&lt;/a&gt;, among other things.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We need to be more honest and direct about the economic benefits that community members bring to Mozilla. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly what this means right now (and of course Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s options are constrained both legally and economically), but we need to do better about acknowledging their contributions to Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s bottom line and making sure there is a fair exchange of value on both sides. At the &lt;em&gt;very minimum&lt;/em&gt;, we need to make sure that people&amp;rsquo;s contributions help them grow professionally or otherwise if we can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee monetary compensation for their efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We need to acknowledge the efforts that our employees make in creating functional communities. This work does not come for free and we need to start acknowledging it in both our career development paths and when looking at individual performance. Similarly, we need to provide better guidance and mentorship on how to do this work in a way that does not extract too hard a personal toll on the people involved &amp;mdash; this is a complex topic, but a lot of it in my opinion comes down to better onboarding practices (which is something we should be doing anyway) as well as setting better boundaries (both in terms of work/life balance, as well as what you&amp;rsquo;ll accept in your interactions).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Finally, what is the end result of our work? Do the software and systems we build genuinely enrich people&amp;rsquo;s lives? Do they become better informed after using our software? Do they make them better decisions? Free software might be good in itself, but one must also factor in &lt;em&gt;how it is used&lt;/em&gt; when measuring its social utility (see: Facebook).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the above is easy to address. But the alternatives are either close everything down to public participation (which I&amp;rsquo;d argue will lead to the death of Mozilla as an organization: it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to compete in the marketplace without the backing of the community) or continue down the present path (which I don&amp;rsquo;t think is sustainable either). The last ten years have shown that the &amp;ldquo;open source on auto-pilot&amp;rdquo; approach just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect these problems aren&amp;rsquo;t specific to Mozilla and affect other communities that work in the open. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in hearing other perspectives on this family of problems: if you have anything to add, my contact information is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“This Week in Glean” is a series of blog posts that the Glean Team at Mozilla is using to try to communicate better about our work. They could be release notes, documentation, hopes, dreams, or whatever: so long as it is inspired by Glean. You can find &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/appendix/twig.html"&gt;an index of all TWiG posts online.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Data group, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the availability of the first milestone of the Glean Dictionary, a project to provide a comprehensive &amp;ldquo;data dictionary&amp;rdquo; of the data Mozilla collects inside its products and how it makes use of it. You can access it via this development URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dictionary.protosaur.dev/"&gt;https://dictionary.protosaur.dev/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2021/01/glean-dictionary.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this first milestone was to provide an equivalent to the &lt;a href="https://probes.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;popular &amp;ldquo;probe&amp;rdquo; dictionary&lt;/a&gt; for newer applications which use the Glean SDK, such as Firefox for Android. As Firefox on Glean (FoG) comes together, this will also serve as an index of what data is available for Firefox and how to access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the vision of this project is to act as a showcase for Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s practices around &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/lean-data/"&gt;lean data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection"&gt;data governance&lt;/a&gt;: you&amp;rsquo;ll note that every metric and ping in the Glean Dictionary has a data review associated with it &amp;mdash; giving the general public a window into what we&amp;rsquo;re collecting and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to displaying a browsable inventory of the low-level metrics which these applications collect, the Glean Dictionary also provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Code search functionality (via &lt;a href="https://searchfox.org"&gt;Searchfox&lt;/a&gt;) to see where any given data collection is defined and used.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Information on how this information is represented inside Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s BigQuery data store.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Where available, links to browse / view this information using the &lt;a href="https://glam.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;Glean Aggregated Metrics Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; (GLAM).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, we&amp;rsquo;ll be expanding the Glean Dictionary to include derived datasets and dashboards / reports built using this data, as well as allow users to add their own annotations on metric behaviour via a GitHub-based documentation system. For more information, see the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OkTWA3rsSJ0m5g9GDnxXVUMkJP-xJMQk_bDgDq-Z9xM/edit#"&gt;project proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Glean Dictionary is the result of the efforts of many contributors, both inside and outside Mozilla Data. Special shout-out to &lt;a href="https://www.linh-nguyen.com/outreachy"&gt;Linh Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, who has been moving mountains inside the codebase as part of an Outreachy internship with us. We welcome your feedback and involvement! For more information, see our &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glean-dictionary"&gt;project repository&lt;/a&gt; and Matrix channel (&lt;a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#glean-dictionary:mozilla.org"&gt;#glean-dictionary on chat.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;A bit belatedly, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a short retrospective on &lt;a href="https://alpha.iodide.io"&gt;Iodide&lt;/a&gt;: an effort to create a compelling, client-centred scientific notebook environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not writing a ton about it (the sole exception being &lt;a href="/blog/2019/03/new-ideas-old-buildings/"&gt;this brief essay&lt;/a&gt; about my conservative choice for the server backend) Iodide took up a very large chunk of my mental energy from late 2018 through 2019. It was also essentially my only attempt at working on something that was on its way to being an actual &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; while at Mozilla: while I&amp;rsquo;ve led other projects that have been interesting and/or impactful in my 9 odd-years here (&lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;perfherder&lt;/a&gt; being the biggest successes), they fall firmly into the &amp;ldquo;internal tools supporting another product&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it&amp;rsquo;s probably safe to say that the project has wound down: no one is being paid to work on Iodide and it&amp;rsquo;s essentially in extreme maintenance mode. Before it&amp;rsquo;s put to bed altogether, I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a few notes about its approach, where I think it had big advantanges, and where it seems to fall short. I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude with some areas I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore (or would like to see others explore!). I&amp;rsquo;d like to emphasize that this is &lt;em&gt;my opinion only&lt;/em&gt;: the rest of the Iodide core team no doubt have their own thoughts. That said, let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-iodide-anyway"&gt;What is Iodide, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;rsquo;s interesting about a product like Iodide is that people tend to project their hopes and dreams onto it: if you asked any given member of the Iodide team to give a 200 word description of the project, you&amp;rsquo;d probably get a slightly different answer emphasizing different things. That said, a fair initial approximation of the project vision would be &amp;ldquo;a scientific notebook like Jupyter, but running in the browser&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what Jupyter does: at heart, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a Python &amp;ldquo;kernel&amp;rdquo; (read: interpreter), fronted by a webserver. You send snipits of the code to the interpreter via a web interface and they would faithfully be run on the backend (either on your local machine in a separate process or a server in the cloud). Results are then be returned back to the web interface and then rendered by the browser in one form or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iodide&amp;rsquo;s model is quite similar, with one difference: instead of running the kernel in another process or somewhere in the cloud, all the heavy lifting happens &lt;em&gt;in the browser itself&lt;/em&gt;, using the local JavaScript and/or WebAssembly runtime. The very first version of the product that Hamilton Ulmer and Brendan Colloran came up with was &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; in this category: it had no server-side component whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, even applications like Jupyter do a fair amount of computation on the client side to render a user interface and the results of computations: the distinction is not as clear cut as you might think. But in general I think the premise holds: if you load an iodide notebook today (still possible on alpha.iodide.io! no account required), the only thing that comes from the server is a little bit of static JavaScript and a flat file delivered as a JSON payload. All the &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; of whatever computation you might come up with happens on the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the default tryit iodide notebook to give an idea of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%% fetch
// load a js library and a csv file with a fetch cell
js: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/4.10.2/d3.js
text: csvDataString = https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/5cei-gny5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

%% js
// parse the data using the d3 library (and show the value in the console)
parsedData = d3.csvParse(csvDataString)

%% js
// replace the text in the report element "htmlInMd"
document.getElementById('htmlInMd').innerText = parsedData[0].Address

%% py
# use python to select some of the data
from js import parsedData
[x['Address'] for x in parsedData if x['Lead Remediation'] == 'true']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;%%&lt;/code&gt; delimiters indicate individual cells. The &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; cell is an iodide-native cell with its own logic to load the specified resources into a JavaScript variables when evaluated. &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;py&lt;/code&gt; cells direct the browser to interpret the code inside of them, which causes the DOM to mutate. From these building blocks (and a few others), you can build up an interactive report which can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be freely forked and edited by anyone who cares to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, I think Iodide has more in common with services like Glitch or Codepen than with Jupyter. In effect, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly offering a way to build up a static web page (doing whatever) using web technologies&amp;mdash; even if the user interface affordances and cell-based computation model might remind you more of a scientific notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-works-well-about-this-approach"&gt;What works well about this approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a few nifty things that come from doing things this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The environment is easily extensible for those familiar with JavaScript or other client side technologies. There is no need to mess with strange plugin architectures or APIs or conform to the opinions of someone else on what options there are for data visualization and presentation. If you want to use jQuery inside your notebook for a user interface widget, just import it and go!&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The architecture scales to many, many users: since all the computation happens on the client, the server&amp;rsquo;s only role is to store and retrieve notebook content. alpha.iodide.io has happily been running on Heroku&amp;rsquo;s least expensive dyno type for its entire existence.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Reproducibility: so long as the iodide notebook has no references to data on third party servers with authentiction, there is no stopping someone from being able to reproduce whatever computations led to your results.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Related to reproducibility, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to &lt;em&gt;build off&lt;/em&gt; of someone else&amp;rsquo;s notebook or exploration, since everything is so self-contained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to be surprised and impressed with what people come up with in the Jupyter ecosystem so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to claim these are things that &amp;ldquo;only Iodide&amp;rdquo; (or other tools like it) can do&amp;mdash; what I will say is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen many things that combine both the conciseness and expressiveness of iomd. The beauty of the web is that there is such an abundance of tutorials and resources to support creating interactive content: when building iodide notebooks, I would freely borrow from resources such as MDN and Stackoverflow, instead of being locked into what the authoring software thinks one should be able express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whats-awkward"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s awkward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every silver lining has a cloud and (unfortunately) Iodide has a pretty big one. Depending on how you use Iodide, you will almost certainly run into the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;You are limited by the computational affordances provided by the browser: there is no obvious way to offload long-running or expensive computations to a cluster of machines using a technology like &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/"&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Long-running computations will block the main thread, causing your notebook to become extremely unresponsive for the duration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, I (and most people?) can usually live with. Computers are quite powerful these days and most data tasks I&amp;rsquo;m interested in are easily within the range of capabilities of my laptop. In the cases where I need to do something larger scale, I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy to fire up a Jupyter Notebook, BigQuery Console, or &amp;lt;other tool of choice&amp;gt; to do the heavy-lifting, and then move back to a client-side approach to visualize and explore my results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is much harder to deal with, since it means that the process of exploration that is so key to scientific computing. I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy to wait 5 seconds, 15 seconds, even a minute for a longer-running computation to complete but if I see the slow script dialog and everything about my environment grinds to a halt, it not only blocks my work but causes me to lose faith in the system. How do I know if it&amp;rsquo;s even going to finish?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This occurs way more often than you might think: even a simple notebook loading pandas (via pyodide) can cause Firefox to pop up the slow script dialog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/11/iodide-slow-script.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this so? Aren&amp;rsquo;t browsers complex beasts which can do a million things in parallel these days? Only sort of: while the graphical and network portions of loading and using a web site are highly parallel, JavaScript and any changes to the DOM &lt;em&gt;can only occur synchronously&lt;/em&gt; by default. Let&amp;rsquo;s break down a simple iodide example which trivially hangs the browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%% js

while (1) { true }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/6487/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; (but you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on here? When you execute that cell, the web site&amp;rsquo;s sole thread is now devoted to running that infinite loop. No longer can any other JavaScript-based event handler be run, so for example the text editor (which uses &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt; under the hood) and menus are now completely unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iodide team was aware of this issue since I joined the project. There were no end of discussions about how to work around it, but they never really come to a satisfying conclusion. The most obvious solution is to move the cell&amp;rsquo;s computation to a web worker, but workers don&amp;rsquo;t have synchronous access to the DOM which is required for web content to work as you&amp;rsquo;d expect. While there are projects like &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink"&gt;ComLink&lt;/a&gt; that attempt to bridge this divide, they require both a fair amount of skill and code to use effectively. As mentioned above, one of the key differentiators between iodide and other notebook environments is that tools like jQuery, d3, etc. &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo;. That is, you can take a code snipit off the web and run it inside an iodide notebook: there&amp;rsquo;s no workaround I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find which maintains that behaviour &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ensures that the Iodide notebook environment is always responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while for this to really hit home, but having some separation from the project, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that the problem is that the underlying technology isn&amp;rsquo;t designed for the task we were asking of it, nor is it likely to ever be in the near future. While the web (by which I mean not only the browser, but the ecosystem of popular tooling and libraries that has been built on top of it) has certainly grown in scope to things it was never envisioned to handle like games and office applications, it&amp;rsquo;s just not optimized for what I&amp;rsquo;d call &amp;ldquo;editable content&amp;rdquo;. That is, the situation where a web page offers affordances for manipulating its own representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While modern web browsers have evolved to (sort of) protect one errant site from bringing the whole thing down, they certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t evolved to protect a particular site against &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;. And why would they? Web developers usually work in the terminal and text editor: the assumption is that if their test code misbehaves, they&amp;rsquo;ll just kill their tab and start all over again. Application state is persisted either on-disk or inside an external database, so nothing will really be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this ever change? Possibly, but I think it would be a radical rethinking of what the web is, and I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what would motivate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-way-forward"&gt;A way forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on iodide, we were fond of looking at this diagram, which was taken from &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3173606"&gt;this study of the data science workflow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/11/ds-workflow.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It describes how people typically perform computational inquiry: typically you would poke around with some raw data, run some transformations on it. Only after that process was complete would you start trying to build up a &amp;ldquo;presentation&amp;rdquo; of your results to your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that Iodide&amp;rsquo;s strong suit was the &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; part of this workflow, rather than collaboration and exploration. My strong suspicion is that we actually want to use different tools for each one of these tasks. Coincidentally, this also maps to the bulk of my experience working with data at Mozilla, using iodide or not: my most successful front-end data visualization projects were typically the distilled result of a very large number of adhoc explorations (python scripts, SQL queries, Jupyter notebooks, &amp;hellip;). The actual visualization itself contains very little computational meat: basically &amp;ldquo;just enough&amp;rdquo; to let the user engage with the data fruitfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately much of my work in this area uses semi-sensitive internal Mozilla data so can&amp;rsquo;t be publicly shared, but here&amp;rsquo;s one example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/11/bq-migration-burndown.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/3593/?viewMode=report"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built this dashboard in a single day to track our progress (resolved/open bugs) when we were migrating our data platform from AWS to GCP. It was useful: it let us quickly visualize which areas needed more attention and gave upper management more confidence that we were moving closer to our goal. However, there was little computation going on in the client: most of the backend work was happening in our &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org"&gt;Bugzilla instance&lt;/a&gt;: the iodide notebook just does a little bit of post-processing to visualize the results in a useful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, I still think there is a place in the world for an interactive &lt;em&gt;visualization&lt;/em&gt; environment built on principles similar to iodide: basically a markdown editor augmented with primitives oriented around data exploration (for example, charts and data tables), with allowances to bring in any JavaScript library you might want. However, any in-depth data processing would be assumed to have mostly been run elsewhere, in advance. The editing environment could either be the browser or a code editor running on your local machine, per user preference: in either case, there would not be any really important computational state running in the browser, so things like dynamic reloading (or just closing an errant tab) should not cause the user to lose any work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would give you the best of both worlds: you could easily create compelling visualizations that are easy to share and remix at minimal cost (because all the work happens in the browser), but you could &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; use whatever existing tools work best for your initial data exploration (whether that be JavaScript or the more traditional Python data science stack). And because the new tool has a reduced scope, I think building such an environment would be a much more tractable project for an individual or small group to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on this in the future, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://teonbrooks.com/"&gt;Teon Brooks&lt;/a&gt; and Devin Bayly for reviewing an early draft of this post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;Periodically the discussion comes up about pruning away old stored Firefox build artifacts in S3. Each build is tens of megabytes, multiply that by the number of platforms we support and the set of revisions we churn through on a daily basis, and pretty soon you&amp;rsquo;re talking about real money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came up recently in a discussion about &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.platform/c/0OV_M3b-cMM/m/kkknfFdECgAJ"&gt;removing the legacy taskcluster deployment&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; what do we actually lose by cutting back our archive of integration builds? The main reason to keep them around is to facilitate bisection testing with &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt;, to find out when a bug was introduced. Up to now, discussions about this have been a bit hand-wavey: we do keep logs about who&amp;rsquo;s accessing old builds, but it&amp;rsquo;s never been clear whether it was mozregression accessing them or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, now that &lt;a href="/blog/2020/05/this-week-in-glean-mozregression-telemetry-part-2/"&gt;mozregression has some telemetry&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a little easier to get some answers on what people are actually doing. This query gets the distribution of build ages (launched or bisected) over the past 6 months, at a month long granularity.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-08-17-mozregression-and-older-builds-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-17-mozregression-and-older-builds-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ages are relative to the date mozregression was launched: for example, if someone asked for a build from May 2019 in June 2020, the number would be &amp;ldquo;13&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usage_build_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usage_bad_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usage_launch_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran this query on sql.telemetry.mozilla.org and generated a box plot, broken down by product and build type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/08/mozregression-build-age-box-plot.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/73968#184980"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; (requires Mozilla LDAP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Firefox shippable builds are the number one thing people try to bisect. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little bit of a closer look at what&amp;rsquo;s going on there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/08/mozregression-build-age-box-plot-detail.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median value is 1, which indicates that most people are bisecting builds within one month of the day in which mozregression was run. And the &lt;a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/upper-and-lower-fences/"&gt;upper fence&lt;/a&gt; result is 6, suggesting that most of the time people are looking at a regression range that is within a 6 month range. However, looking more closely at the data points themselves (the little points in the chart above), there are a considerable number of outliers where a range greater than 20 months was asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; which brings up to the question that we want to answer. Given that getting old builds isn&amp;rsquo;t that common (which we sort of knew already, based on the access patterns in the S3 logs), what is the impact of the times that we do? And it&amp;rsquo;s here where I have to throw up my hands and say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; and suggest that we go back to empirical observation and user research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go back to the thread I linked above, and see that core Firefox/Gecko developers find the ability to get a precise regression range for older revisions valuable. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning is that mozregression isn&amp;rsquo;t run that often, compared to a product that we ship: on the order of 50 to 100 times per a day. But when it comes to internal tooling, a small amount of use might have a big impact: if a mozregression invocation a developer a few hours (or more), that&amp;rsquo;s a real benefit to Firefox and Mozilla. The same argument might apply here, where a small number of bisections on older builds might have a disproportionate impact on the quality of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li id="2020-08-17-mozregression-and-older-builds-footnote-1-definition" class="footnote-definition"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I only added the telemetry to capture this information &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651401"&gt;relatively recently&lt;/a&gt;, so we&amp;rsquo;re actually only looking at about a month of data in this post. We&amp;rsquo;ll have more complete results later this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#2020-08-17-mozregression-and-older-builds-footnote-1-return"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“This Week in Glean” is a series of blog posts that the Glean Team at Mozilla is using to try to communicate better about our work. They could be release notes, documentation, hopes, dreams, or whatever: so long as it is inspired by Glean. You can find &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/appendix/twig.html"&gt;an index of all TWiG posts online.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a special guest post by non-Glean-team member William Lachance!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year or so, there&amp;rsquo;s been a significant shift in the way we (Data Engineering) think about application-submitted data @ Mozilla, but although we have a new application-based SDK based on these principles (&lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html"&gt;the Glean SDK&lt;/a&gt;), most of our &lt;a href="https://telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;data tools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; have not yet been updated to reflect this new state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this story is known &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; Mozilla Data Engineering, but I thought it might be worth jotting them down into a blog post as a point of reference for people outside the immediate team. Knowing this may provide some context for some our activities and efforts over the next year or two, at least until our tools, documentation, and tribal knowledge evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the key differences are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Instead of just one application we care about, there are many.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Instead of just caring about (mostly&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) one type of ping (the Firefox &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; ping), an individual application may submit &lt;em&gt;many different&lt;/em&gt; types of pings in the course of their use.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Instead of having both probes (histogram, scalar, or other data type) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bespoke parametric values in a JSON schema like the &lt;a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/data/environment.html"&gt;telemetry environment&lt;/a&gt;, there are now only &lt;em&gt;metric types&lt;/em&gt; which are explicitly defined as part of each ping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new world is pretty exciting and freeing, but there is some new domain complexity that we need to figure out how to navigate. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss that in my last section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-old-world-firefox-is-king"&gt;The Old World: Firefox is king&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until roughly mid&amp;ndash;2019, Firefox was the centre of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s data world (with the occasional nod to Firefox for Android, which uses the same source repository). The Data Platform (often called &amp;ldquo;Telemetry&amp;rdquo;) was explicitly designed to cater to the needs of Firefox Developers (and to a lesser extent, product/program managers) and a set of bespoke tooling was built on top of our data pipeline architecture - &lt;a href="https://ravitillo.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/an-overview-of-mozillas-data-pipeline/"&gt;this blog post from 2017 describes much of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In outline, the model is simple: on the client side, assuming a given user had not turned off Telemetry, during the course of a day&amp;rsquo;s operation Firefox would keep track of various measures, called &amp;ldquo;probes&amp;rdquo;. At the end of that duration, it would submit a JSON-encoded &amp;ldquo;main ping&amp;rdquo; to our servers with the probe information and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas/blob/97bac7acaaa5cb328d7f0f7348f3ddaaae657eda/schemas/telemetry/main/main.4.schema.json"&gt;a bunch of other mostly hand-specified junk&lt;/a&gt;, which would then find its way to a &amp;ldquo;data lake&amp;rdquo; (read: an Amazon S3 bucket). On top of this, we provided a &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/python_moztelemetry/"&gt;python API&lt;/a&gt; (built on top of &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html"&gt;PySpark&lt;/a&gt;) which enabled people inside Mozilla to query all submitted pings across our usage population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only type of low-level object that was hard to keep track of was the list of probes: Firefox is a complex piece of software and there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; aspects of it we wanted to instrument to validate performance and quality of the product - especially on the more-experimental Nightly and Beta channels. To solve this problem, a &lt;a href="https://probes.telemetry.mozilla.org/"&gt;probe dictionary&lt;/a&gt; was created to help developers find measures that corresponded to the product area that they were interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a higher-level, accessing this type of data using the python API quickly became slow and frustrating: the aggregation of years of Firefox ping data was hundreds of terabytes big, and even taking advantage of PySpark&amp;rsquo;s impressive capabilities, querying the data across any reasonably large timescale was slow and expensive. Here, the solution was to create derived datasets which enabled fast(er) access to pings and other derived measures, document them on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org, and then allow access to them through tools like &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/stmo.html"&gt;sql.telemetry.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://telemetry.mozilla.org/new-pipeline/dist.html"&gt;Measurement Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-new-world-more-of-everything"&gt;The New World: More of everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the old world, other products that submitted telemetry &lt;em&gt;existed&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. Firefox for Android, Firefox for iOS, the venerable FirefoxOS) but I would not call them first-class citizens. Most of our documentation treated them as (at best) weird edge cases. At the time of this writing, you can see this distinction clearly on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org where there is one (fairly detailed) tutorial called &amp;ldquo;Choosing a Desktop Dataset&amp;rdquo; while essentially all other products are lumped into &amp;ldquo;Choosing a Mobile Dataset&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/07/docs-tmo-pic.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new universe of mobile products are probably the most notable addition to our list of things we want to keep track of, they&amp;rsquo;re only one piece of the puzzle. Really we&amp;rsquo;re interested in measuring &lt;em&gt;all the things&lt;/em&gt; (in accordance with our &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/lean-data/"&gt;lean data practices&lt;/a&gt;, of course) including tools we use to &lt;em&gt;build our products&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozPhab"&gt;mozphab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In expanding our scope, we&amp;rsquo;ve found that mobile (and other products) have different requirements that influence what data we would want to send and when. For example, sending one blob of JSON multiple times per day might make sense for performance metrics on a desktop product (which is usually on a fast, unmetered network) but is much less acceptable on mobile (where every byte counts). For this reason, it makes sense to have &lt;em&gt;different ping types&lt;/em&gt; for the same product, not just one. For example, Fenix (the new Firefox for Android) sends a tiny baseline ping&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-2-return"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on every run to (roughly) measure daily active users and a larger metrics ping sent on a (roughly) daily interval to measure (for example) a distribution of page load times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we found that naively collecting certain types of data as raw histograms or inside the schema didn&amp;rsquo;t always work well. For example, encoding session lengths as plain integers &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514392"&gt;would often produce weird results in the case of clock skew&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, we decided to &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/index.html"&gt;standardize on a set of well-defined metrics&lt;/a&gt; using Glean, which tries to minimize footguns. We explicitly no longer allow clients to submit arbitrary JSON or values as part of a telemetry ping: if you have a use case not covered by the existing metrics, &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Glean/Adding_or_changing_Glean_metric_types"&gt;make a case for it and add it to the list&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let&amp;rsquo;s take a (subset) of what we might be looking at in terms of what the Fenix application sends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/07/fenix-pings-diagram.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2020/07/fenix-pings-diagram.mmd"&gt;mermaid source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top level we segment based on the &amp;ldquo;application&amp;rdquo; (just Fenix in this example). Just below that, there are the pings that this application might submit (I listed three: the baseline and metrics pings described above, along with a &amp;ldquo;migration&amp;rdquo; ping, which tracks metrics when a user migrates from Fennec to Fenix). And below &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; there are different types of metrics included in the pings: I listed a few that came out of a quick scan of the Fenix BigQuery tables using my &lt;a href="https://mozilla-schema-dictionary.netlify.app/#!/tables/org_mozilla_fenix.metrics"&gt;prototype schema dictionary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually only the surface-level: at the time of this writing, Fenix has no fewer than 12 different ping types and &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; different metrics inside each of them.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-3-return"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On a client level, the new Glean SDK provides easy-to-use primitives to help developers collect this type of information in a principled, privacy-preserving way: for example, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/data-review"&gt;data review&lt;/a&gt; is built into every metric type. But what about after it hits our ingestion endpoints?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand-crafting schemas, data ingestion pipelines, and individualized ETL scripts for such a large matrix of applications, ping types, and measurements would quickly become intractable. Instead, we (Mozilla Data Engineering) refactored our data pipeline to parse out the information from the Glean schemas and then create tables in our BigQuery datastore corresponding to what&amp;rsquo;s in them - this has proceeded as an extension to our (now somewhat misnamed) &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper"&gt;probe-scraper&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then query this data directly (see &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/accessing_glean_data.html"&gt;accessing glean data&lt;/a&gt;) or build up a derived dataset using our SQL-based ETL system, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/"&gt;BigQuery-ETL&lt;/a&gt;. This part of the equation has been working fairly well, I&amp;rsquo;d say: we now have a diverse set of products producing Glean telemetry and submitting it to our servers, and the amount of manual effort required to add each application was minimal (aside from adding new capabilities to the platform as we went along).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What hasn&amp;rsquo;t quite kept pace is our tooling to make navigating and using this new collection of data tractable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-could-bring-this-all-together"&gt;What could bring this all together?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, this new world is quite powerful and gives Mozilla a bunch of new capabilities but it isn&amp;rsquo;t yet well documented and we lack the tools to easily connect the dots from &amp;ldquo;I have a product question&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I know how to write an SQL query / Spark Job to answer it&amp;rdquo; or (better yet) &amp;ldquo;this product dashboard will answer it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, our defacto answer has been some combination of &amp;ldquo;Use the probe dictionary / telemetry.mozilla.org&amp;rdquo; and/or &amp;ldquo;refer to docs.telemetry.mozilla.org&amp;rdquo;. I submit that we&amp;rsquo;re at the point where these approaches break down: as mentioned above, there are many more types of data we now need to care about than just &amp;ldquo;probes&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;metrics&amp;rdquo;, in Glean-parlance). When we just cared about the main ping, we could write dataset documentation for its recommended access point (&lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/batch_view/main_summary/reference.html"&gt;main_summary&lt;/a&gt;) and the raw number of derived datasets was managable. But in this new world, where we have &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; applications times &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; ping types, the number of canonical ping tables are now so many that documenting them all on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org no longer makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I thought that &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog"&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Data Catalog&lt;/a&gt; (billed as offering &amp;ldquo;a unified view of all your datasets&amp;rdquo;) might provide a solution, but on further examination it only solves part of the problem: it provides only a view on your BigQuery tables and it isn&amp;rsquo;t designed to provide detailed information on the domain objects we care about (products, pings, measures, and tools). You can map some of the properties from these objects onto the tables (e.g. adding a probe&amp;rsquo;s description field to the column representing it in the BigQuery table), but Data Calalog&amp;rsquo;s interface to surfacing and filtering through this information is rather slow and clumsy and requires detailed knowledge of how these higher level concepts relate to BigQuery primitives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what I think we need is a &lt;em&gt;new system&lt;/em&gt; which allows a data practitioner (Data Scientist, Firefox Engineer, Data Engineer, Product Manager, whoever) to visualize the relevant set of domain objects relevant to their product/feature of interest &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; then map them to specific BigQuery tables and other resources (e.g. visualizations using tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/glam"&gt;GLAM&lt;/a&gt;) which allow people to quickly answer questions so we can make better products. Basically, I am thinking of some combination of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The existing probe dictionary (derived from existing product metadata)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A new &amp;ldquo;application&amp;rdquo; dictionary (derived from some simple to-be-defined application metadata description)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A new &amp;ldquo;ping&amp;rdquo; dictionary (derived from existing product metadata)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A BigQuery schema dictionary (I wrote up a &lt;a href="https://mozilla-schema-dictionary.netlify.app/"&gt;prototype of this a couple weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;) to map between these higher-level objects and what&amp;rsquo;s in our low-level data store&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Documentation for derived datasets generated by BigQuery-ETL (ideally stored alongside the ETL code itself, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to keep up to date)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A data tool dictionary describing how to easily &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; the above data in various ways (e.g. SQL query, dashboard plot, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound ambitious, but it&amp;rsquo;s basically just a system for collecting and visualizing various types of documentation&amp;mdash; something we have proven we know how to do. And I think a product like this could be incredibly empowering, not only for the internal audience at Mozilla but also the &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; audience who wants to support us but has valid concerns about what we&amp;rsquo;re collecting and why: since this system is based entirely on systems which are already open (inside GitHub or Mercurial repositories), there is no reason we can&amp;rsquo;t make it available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li id="2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-1-definition" class="footnote-definition"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Technically, &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/pings.html"&gt;there are various other types of pings&lt;/a&gt; submitted by Firefox, but the main ping is the one 99% of people care about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-1-return"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-2-definition" class="footnote-definition"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This is actually a capability that the Glean SDK provides, so other products (e.g. Lockwise, Firefox for iOS) also benefit from this capability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-2-return"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-3-definition" class="footnote-definition"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The scope of this data collection comes from the fact that Fenix is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; large and complex application. rather than a desire to collect everything just because we can&amp;mdash; smaller efforts like mozregression collect a &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/documentation/telemetry.html"&gt;much more limited set of data&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#2020-07-16-mozilla-telemetry-in-2020-footnote-3-return"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item>

   <title>mozregression GUI: now available for Linux</title>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/AnAverageHuman"&gt;@AnAverageHuman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt; once again has an easy to use and install GUI version for Linux! This used to work a few years ago, but got broken with some changes in the mozregression-python2 era and didn&amp;rsquo;t get resolved until now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/06/mozregression-on-linux.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an area where using telemetry in mozregression can help us measure the impact of a change like this: although Windows still dominates in terms of marketshare, Linux is very widely used by contributors &amp;mdash; of the usage of mozregression in the past 2 months, fully 30% of the sessions were on Linux (and it is possible we were undercounting that due to &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1646402"&gt;bug 1646402&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/06/mozregression-usage-share-by-os.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/72363/source"&gt;link to query&lt;/a&gt; (internal-only)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to watch the usage numbers for Linux evolve over the next few months. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see what percentage of users on that platform prefer a GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="appendix-reducing-mozregression-guis-massive-size"&gt;Appendix: reducing mozregression-GUI&amp;rsquo;s massive size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;rsquo;s bothered me a bunch lately is that the mozregression GUI&amp;rsquo;s size is &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; and this is even more apparent on Linux, where the initial distribution of the GUI came in at over 120 megabytes! Why so big? There were a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/"&gt;PySide2&lt;/a&gt; (the GUI library we use) is very large (10s of megabytes), and &lt;a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/"&gt;PyInstaller&lt;/a&gt; packages &lt;em&gt;all of it&lt;/em&gt; by default into your application distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The binary/rust portions of the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/glean-sdk/"&gt;Glean Python SDK&lt;/a&gt; were been built with debugging information included (basically as a carry-over when it was a pre-alpha product), which made it 38 megabytes big (!) on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;On Linux at least, a large number of other system libraries are packaged into the distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few aspects of this were under our control: Ian Moody (:Kwan) and myself crafted a script to manually remove unneeded PySide2 libraries as part of the packaging process. The Glean team was awesome-as-always and quickly rebuilt Glean without debugging information (this was basically an oversight). Finally, I managed to shave off a few more megabytes by reverting the Linux build to an earlier version of Ubuntu (Xenial), which is something I had been meaning to do anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after doing all of these things, the end result is still a little underwhelming: the mozregression GUI distribution on Linux is still 79.5 megabytes big. There are probably other things we could do, but we&amp;rsquo;re definitely entering the land of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, my main takeaway is just not to build an application like this in Python unless you absolutely have to (e.g. you&amp;rsquo;re building an application which needs system-level access). The web is a pretty wonderful medium for creating graphical applications these days, and by using it you sidestep these type of installation issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about markdown, presentation, dashboards, and other frontendy sorts of things lately, partly inspired by my work on &lt;a href="https://iodide.io"&gt;Iodide&lt;/a&gt; last year, partly inspired by my recent efforts on improving &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;docs.telemetry.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t fully fleshed out my thoughts on this yet, but in general I think blogs (for some value of &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;) are still a great way to communicate ideas and concepts to an interested audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many organizations, Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s gone down the path of Google Docs, Zoom and Slack which makes me more than a little sad: good ideas disappear down the memory hole &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; quickly with these tools, not to mention the fact that they are closed-by-default (even to people inside Mozilla!). My view on &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; is a bit more nuanced than it used to be: I no longer think everything need be all-public, all-the-time&amp;mdash; but I still think talking about and through our ideas (even if imperfectly formed or stated) with a broad audience builds trust and leads to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some way we can blend some of these old school ideas (blogs, newsgroups, open discussion forums) with better technology and &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/"&gt;social practices&lt;/a&gt;? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>A principled reorganization of docs.telemetry.mozilla.org</title>

   <description>
&lt;p&gt;(this post is aimed primarily at an internal audience, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and make it public as a blog post)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a bunch over the past few months about the Mozilla data organization&amp;rsquo;s documentation story. We have a first class data platform here at Mozilla, but using it to answer questions, especially for newer employees, can be quite intimidating. As we continue our collective journey to becoming a modern data-driven organization, part of the formula for unlocking this promise is making the tools and platforms we create accessible to a broad internal audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My data peers are a friendly group of people and we have historically been good at answering questions on forums like the #fx-metrics slack channel: we&amp;rsquo;ll keep doing this. That said, our time is limited: we need a common resource for helping bring people up to speed on how to use the data platform to answer common questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our documentation site, &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org"&gt;docs.telemetry.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;, was meant to be this resource: however in the last couple of years an understanding of its purpose has been (at least partially) lost and it has become somewhat overgrown with content that isn&amp;rsquo;t very relevant to those it&amp;rsquo;s intended to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post&amp;rsquo;s goal is to re-establish a mission for our documentation site &amp;mdash; towards the end, some concrete proposals on what to change are also outlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="setting-the-audience"&gt;Setting the audience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;docs.telemetry.mozilla.org was and is meant to be a resource useful for &lt;em&gt;data practitioners&lt;/em&gt; within Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of different data practioners and their use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A data scientist performing an experiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A data analyst producing a report on the effectiveness of a recent marketing campaign&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A Firefox engineer trying to understand the performance characteristics of a new feature&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A technical product manager trying to understand the characteristics of a particular user segment&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A quality assurance engineer trying to understand the severity of a Firefox crash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a range of skills that these different groups bring to the table, but there are some common things we expect a data practitioner to have, whatever their formal job description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;At least some programming and analytical experience&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Comfortable working with and understanding complex data systems with multiple levels of abstraction (for example: the relationship between the Firefox browser which produces Telemetry data and the backend system which processes it)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The time necessary to dig into details&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also &lt;em&gt;excludes&lt;/em&gt; a few groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Senior leadership or executives: they are of course free to use docs.telemetry.mozilla.org if helpful, but it is expected that the type of analytical work covered by the documentation will normally be done by a data practitioner and that relevant concepts and background information will be explained &lt;em&gt;to them&lt;/em&gt; (in the form of high-level dashboards, presentations, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Data Engineering: some of the material on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org may be incidentally useful to this internal audience, but explaining the full details of the data platform itself belongs elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-do-these-users-need"&gt;What do these users need?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, a data practitioner is trying to answer a specific set of questions in the context of an exploration. There are a few things that they need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A working knowledge of how to use the technological tools to answer the questions they might have: for example, how to create a SQL query counting the median value of a particular histogram for a particular usage segment.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A set of guidelines on best practices on how to measure specific things: for example, we want our people using our telemetry systems to use well-formulated practices for measuring things like &amp;ldquo;Monthly Active Users&amp;rdquo; rather than re-inventing such things themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-serves-this-need"&gt;What serves this need?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Ryan Harter &lt;a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/lit-review.html"&gt;did an extensive literature review&lt;/a&gt; on writing documentation on technical subjects - the take away from this exploration is that the global consensus is that we should focus most of our attention on writing practical tutorials which enables our users to perform specific tasks in the service of the above objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a proverb, allegedly attributed to Confucius which goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The understanding we want to build is how to use our data systems and tools to answer questions. Some knowledge of how our data platform works is no doubt necessary to accomplish this, but it is mostly functional knowledge we care about imparting to data practitioners: the best way to build this understanding is to guide users in performing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense intuitively, but it is also borne out by the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; that this is what our users are looking for. Looking through the top pages on Google Analytics, virtually all of them&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-1-return"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; refer either to a cookbook or howto guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/05/docs-tmo-ga.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, this allows us to significantly narrow our focus for docs.telemetry.mozilla.org. We no longer need to worry about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Providing lists or summaries of data tools available inside Mozilla&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-2-return"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: we can talk about tools only as needed in the context of tasks they want to accomplish. We may want to keep such a list handy elsewhere for some other reason (e.g. internal auditing purposes), but we can safely say that it belongs somewhere else, like the Mozilla wiki, mana, or the telemetry.mozilla.org portal.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Detailed reference on the technical details of the data platform implementation. Links to this kind of material can be surfaced inside the documentation where relevant, but it is expected that an implementation reference will normally be stored and presented within the context of the tools themselves (a good example would be &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/gcp-ingestion/"&gt;the existing documentation for GCP ingestion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Detailed reference on all data sets, ping types, or probes: hand-written documentation for this kind of information is difficult to keep up to date with manual processes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-3-return"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and is best generated automatically and browsed with tools like the &lt;a href="https://probes.telemetry.mozilla.org/"&gt;probe dictionary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Detailed reference material on how to submit Telemetry. While an overview of how to &lt;em&gt;think about&lt;/em&gt; submitting telemetry may be in scope (recall that we consider Firefox engineers a kind of data practitioner), the details are really a seperate topic that is better left to another resource which is closer to the implementation (for example, the &lt;a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/"&gt;Firefox Source Documentation&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html"&gt;Glean SDK reference&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanning through the above, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a common theme: avoid overly detailed reference material. The above is not to say that we should avoid background documentation altogether. For example, an understanding of how our data pipeline works is key to understanding how up-to-date a dashboard is expected to be. However, this type of documentation should be written bearing in mind the audience (focusing on what they need to know as data practitioners) and should be surfaced towards the end of the documentation as &lt;em&gt;supporting material&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an exception, there is also a very small amount of reference documentation which we want to put at top-level because it is so important: for example the &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/metrics/index.html"&gt;standard metrics&lt;/a&gt; page describes how we define &amp;ldquo;MAU&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;DAU&amp;rdquo;: these are measures that we want to standardize in the organization, and not have someone re-invent every time they produce an analysis or report. However, we should be very cautious about how much of this &amp;ldquo;front facing&amp;rdquo; material we include: if we overwhelm our audience with details right out of the gate, they are apt to ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concrete-actions"&gt;Concrete actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We should continue working on tutorials on how to perform common tasks: this includes not only the low-level guides that we currently have (e.g. BigQuery and SQL tutorials) but also information on how to effectively use our higher-level, more accessible tools like GLAM and GUD to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Medium term, we should remove the per-dataset documentation and replace it with a graphical tool for browsing this type of information (perhaps &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog"&gt;Google Data Catalog&lt;/a&gt;). Since this is likely to be a rather involved project, we can keep the existing documentation for now &amp;mdash; but for new datasets, we should encourage their authors to write tutorials on how to use them effectively (assuming they are of broad general interest) instead of hand-creating schema definitions that are likely to go out of date quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We should set clear expectations and guidelines of what does and doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org as part of a larger style guide. This style guide should be referenced somewhere prominent (perhaps as part of a &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository"&gt;pull request template&lt;/a&gt;) so that historical knowledge of what this resource is for isn&amp;rsquo;t lost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;docs.telemetry.mozilla.org has a huge section devoted to derived datasets (20+), many of which are obsolete or not recommended. At the same time, we are missing explicit reference material for the most commonly used tables in BigQuery (e.g. &lt;code&gt;telemetry.main&lt;/code&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-3-return"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“This Week in Glean” is a series of blog posts that the Glean Team at Mozilla is using to try to communicate better about our work. They could be release notes, documentation, hopes, dreams, or whatever: so long as it is inspired by Glean. You can find &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/appendix/twig.html"&gt;an index of all TWiG posts online.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a special guest post by non-Glean-team member William Lachance!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of an exploration of adding Glean-based telemetry to a python application, in this case &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression"&gt;mozregression&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for automatically finding the source of Firefox regressions (breakage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we left off &lt;a href="/blog/2020/02/this-week-in-glean-special-guest-post-mozregression-telemetry-part-1/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, we had written some test scripts and verified that the data was visible in the debug viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="adding-telemetry-to-mozregression-itself"&gt;Adding Telemetry to mozregression itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this is pretty similar to what I did inside the sample application: the only significant difference is that these are shipped inside a Python application that is meant to be be installable via &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/"&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt;. This means we need to specify the &lt;code&gt;pings.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;metrics.yaml&lt;/code&gt; (located inside the &lt;code&gt;mozregression&lt;/code&gt; subirectory) as package data inside &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="brush: py"&gt;
 &lt;div class="colorful"&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"mozregression"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;package_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"mozregression"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"*.yaml"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also a number of Glean SDK enhancements which we determined were necessary. Most notably, Michael Droettboom added 32-bit Windows wheels to the Glean SDK, which we need to make building the &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/quickstart.html#gui"&gt;mozregression GUI&lt;/a&gt; on Windows possible. In addition, some minor changes needed to be made to Glean&amp;rsquo;s behaviour for it to work correctly with a command-line tool like mozregression &amp;mdash; for example, Glean used to assume that Telemetry would always be disabled via a GUI action so that it would send a deletion ping, but this would obviously not work in an application like mozregression where there is only a configuration file &amp;mdash; so for this case, Glean needed to be modified to check if it had been disabled &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Mike (and others on the Glean team) for so patiently listening to my concerns and modifying Glean accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="getting-data-review"&gt;Getting Data Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we don&amp;rsquo;t just allow random engineers like myself to start collecting data in a product that we ship (even a semi-internal like mozregression). We have &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection"&gt;a process&lt;/a&gt;, overseen by Data Stewards to make sure the information we gather is actually answering important questions and doesn&amp;rsquo;t unnecessarily collect personally identifiable information (e.g. email addresses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the specifics of how this worked out in the case of mozregression in &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581647#c9"&gt;bug 1581647&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glean has some fantastic utilities for generating markdown-based documentation on what information is being collected, which I have made available on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/master/docs/glean/metrics.md"&gt;https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/master/docs/glean/metrics.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generation of this documentation is &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/3454e1eafe83f53a84cb6b10f46649320d5ed097/.travis.yml#L57"&gt;hooked up to mozregression&amp;rsquo;s continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;, so we can sure it&amp;rsquo;s up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also added &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/documentation/telemetry.html"&gt;a quick note&lt;/a&gt; to mozregression&amp;rsquo;s web site describing the feature, along with (very importantly) instructions on how to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enabling-data-ingestion"&gt;Enabling Data Ingestion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a Glean-based project has passed data review, getting our infrastructure to ingest it is pretty straightforward. Normally &lt;a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/adding-glean-to-your-project.html#adding-metadata-about-your-project-to-the-pipeline"&gt;we would suggest just filing a bug&lt;/a&gt; and let us (the data team) handle the details, but since I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; that team, I&amp;rsquo;m going to go a (little bit) of detail into how the sausage is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, we have a collection of ETL (extract-transform-load) scripts in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/"&gt;probe-scraper repository&lt;/a&gt; which are responsible for parsing the ping and probe metadata files that I added to mozregression in the step above and then automatically creating BigQuery tables and updating our ingestion machinery to insert data passed to us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of complicated machinery being the scenes to make this all work, but since it&amp;rsquo;s already in place, adding a new thing like this is relatively simple. The changeset I submitted as part of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/pull/184"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to probe-scraper was all of 9 lines long:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="brush: diff"&gt;
 &lt;div class="colorful"&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/repositories.yaml b/repositories.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-pretty-graph"&gt;A Pretty Graph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the probe scraper change merged and deployed, we can now start querying! A number of tables are automatically created according to the schema outlined above: notably &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; tables corresponding to the usage ping. Using &lt;a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/stmo.html"&gt;sql.telemetry.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; we can start exploring what&amp;rsquo;s out there. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick query I wrote up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="brush: sql"&gt;
 &lt;div class="colorful"&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;DATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;submission_timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usage_variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;moz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shared&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;org_mozilla_mozregression_stable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usage_v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;DATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;submission_timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;2020-04-14&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app_display_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;%.dev%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; which generates a chart like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2020/05/mozregression-variant-usage.png" alt="" /&gt;
 &lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart represents the absolute volume of mozregression usage since April 14th 2020 (around the time when we first released a version of mozregression with Glean telemetry), grouped by mozregression &amp;ldquo;variant&amp;rdquo; (GUI, console, and mach) and date - you can see that (unsurprisingly?) the GUI has the highest usage. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about this more in an upcoming installment, speaking of&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not done yet! Next time, we&amp;rsquo;ll look into making a public-facing dashboard demonstrating these results and making an aggregated version of the mozregression telemetry data publicly accessible to researchers and the general public. If we&amp;rsquo;re lucky, there might even be a bit of &lt;em&gt;data science&lt;/em&gt;. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
