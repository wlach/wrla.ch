<p>Due to some schedule adjustments, it appears as if Metro Transit&#8217;s Google Transit is <a href="http://www.halifax.ca/googletransit/">temporarily out of service</a> while they wait for Google to process their new transit feed.</p>

<p>However, fear not! Unlike Google, obsessive compulsive computer programmer William Lachance works on weekends for free (or the low, low price of $1.99 in the case of iPhone applications) so your thirst for updated transit information can be satisfied. I link to these things often enough on this blog, but here they are again, for the benefit of first time viewers:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://transittogo.mindsea.ca">Transit to Go</a>    In other news, it appears as if Metro Transit has finally seen the light and made their transit information available to anyone who wants it. I would like to think that I might have had <a href="http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/beta-the-public-transit-day-tripper/Content?oid=1098826">something to do with this</a>, but I honestly have no idea. Anyway, if you want to check it out, it&#8217;s available <a href="http://www.halifax.ca/GoogleTransit/developerdata.html">here</a>.</li></ul>

<p>After a month long hiatus, I finally had a chance to get <a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a> back into a working state. The big difference is that we&#8217;re now using the <a href="http://www.mindsea.com/2010/03/03/transit-to-go-pulling-out-all-the-stops/">official HRM transit data</a>. Lots more remains to be done to make this site competitive for 2010 (most of the recent work has been back-end infrastructure stuff), but at least it&#8217;s usable again.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2010/04/oh-the-lines-and-some-help-for-edmonton/">yesterday&#8217;s work</a> out of the way, there weren&#8217;t too many extra steps required before I got a basic version of Transit to Go running for Edmonton. There are definitely bugs and rough edges (the bus names could definitely be better described/formatted, and there&#8217;s some serious geocoder issues), but I think the heavy lifting is out of the way. I guess now would be a good time to open up an invitations to anyone in Edmonton with an iPhone to become part of our free private beta. We&#8217;d love to hear what you think! Just send an email to <a href="mailto:wrlach@gmail.com">wrlach@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>A productive day on the transit development front. Finished up a few big features related to hbus.ca and Transit to Go:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Sped up the graph and database generation by an order of magnitude. Not too exciting from a user perspective, but I should now be able to iterate the codebase much faster.</li>
 <li>Better transit stop / street graph linking: No more does libroutez simply try to find the closest street level vertice to link to when merging transit stops with street information&#8211; we now actually create _new_ street level vertices as needed and link to those. Upshot? Slightly better directions and prettier polylines. When I first thought up the algorithm a month ago, I thought I was totally brilliant, only to later find out that Andrew Byrd had done something almost identical a few months earlier for <a href="http://github.com/andrewbyrd/graphserver">graphserver</a>. Ah well, at least it&#8217;s implemented.</li>
 <li>I <a href="http://gist.github.com/361848">coded up a script</a> to automatically generate synthetic headsigns for GTFS feeds which don&#8217;t have them. This was needed to provide a sensible view for the Edmonton version of Transit to Go. All the props in the world for opening up your data guys, but can&#8217;t you do better than saying that all your buses go in the &#8220;1&#8221; direction? There&#8217;s a reason why it&#8217;s a required field you know. Not only would it help me, but <a href="http://google.com/transit">Google Transit</a> would give better results for your city as well.</li></ul>

<p>Because I don&#8217;t have enough spare time projects (<em>this is a joke</em>), I decided to take on the task of adding a must-requested special iPhone/iPod-touch friendly view for the <a href="http://dev.wifidog.org/">WifiDog</a> authentication server (used by the infamous <a href="http://www.ilesansfil.org/">Île Sans Fil</a>) after being inspired by the WifiDog camp held a few weeks ago at Station C. I finally finally finished up a prototype today. It&#8217;s a bit of a hack, but a relatively clean one&#8211; hopefully some version of it can be integrated into trunk, and users with mobile devices will have a better experience when they&#8217;re on the go in Montr&eacute;al (or any other area with a community-oriented wifidog deployment: I hear there&#8217;s lots).</p>

<p>Oh glorious day, the Nexus One is <a href="http://googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com/2010/03/nexus-one-now-compatible-with-at-3g.html">now available</a> for purchase in Canada!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been feeling less and less enthusiastic about the iPhone lately, in particular after the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/376793/">ridiculous lawsuit against HTC</a>. It&#8217;s no secret that we at <a href="http://navarra.ca">Navarra</a> have been doing quite a bit of work on that platform, as have my associates at <a href="http://mindsea.ca">Mindsea</a>. As long as there&#8217;s demand from our clients, that won&#8217;t change, but as an individual I&#8217;m feeling less and less enthusiastic about supporting a company that (through its actions) demonstrates hostility to the ideals of autonomy and innovation that I hold dear. Now that an attractive alternative is available on reasonable terms, I&#8217;m seriously considering switching horses in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;m overdue in announcing <a href="http://transittogo.mindsea.ca/">Transit to Go</a> a.k.a. &#8220;the iPhone transit map that&#8217;s demonstrably more useful than a paper schedule&#8221; a.k.a. &#8220;your bus departure in 15 seconds or less, no matter where you are&#8221;. I wrote up a <a href="http://www.mindsea.com/blog/2010/03/transit-to-go-pulling-out-all-the-stops/">blog post</a> about it for <a href="http://www.mindsea.com">Mindsea</a>&#8216;s site, if you&#8217;re interested in finding out more.</p>

<p>Second, all this transit excitement has made me start thinking about better routing and geometry algorithms again. I&#8217;ve been experimenting a bit with Brandon Martin Anderson&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/bmander/prender">prender</a> framework, used by the infamous <a href="http://bmander.github.com/graphserver/">Graphserver</a>, and have been pretty happy with the results. It basically lets you do <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> visualizations in python (i.e. no Java coding required). Here&#8217;s a quick picture of it in action, rendering the Nova Scotian road network, as distributed by <a href="http://geobase.ca">geobase</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2010/03/nova_scotia.png" alt="Nova Scotia as rendered by prender" title="Nova Scotia as rendered by prender" width="400" height="220" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" /></p>

<p>The neat thing about this framework is that you can render quickly to an arbitrary level of detail, which should prove very useful when troubleshooting the behavior of some of the code I&#8217;m working on. If anyone is interested in running the framework on MacOS X (like I was), <a href="http://github.com/wlach/prender">my fork</a> of the project has the appropriate patches.</p>

<p>Hurrah, 2010 is upon us!</p>

<p>One new years resolution I have set for myself is to blog more about what I&#8217;m working on. I&#8217;ve learned over the last year that the audience of people who care about your projects <em>in development</em> is vanishingly small. Thus, the need for secrecy in order to make a &#8220;PR splash&#8221; is rather small&#8211; announce far and wide when you have something that <a href="http://hbus.ca">people can use</a> by all means, but don&#8217;t worry too much about talking about what you&#8217;re working on with the internets.</p>

<p>In this spirit, some projects I&#8217;m 99% certain I&#8217;ll be releasing publicly in 2010:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/wlach/neocoder">neocoder</a></strong> A lightweight geocoding library, with wrapper libraries for your language of choice. Written in C++ using <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> and boost regular expressions. Will support both <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="http://geobase.ca">GeoBase</a> GML as input. Currently in development on github, hoping to release with routez (as its geocoding component).</li>
 <li><strong>routez</strong> A generic travel planning web service, written in python using the <a href="http://django-project.org">django</a> framework and the <a href="http://github.com/wlach/libroutez">libroutez</a> libraries. This is basically the software behind <a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a>&#8230; the goal for 2010 is to clean it up and make it generic by clearing out the Halifax-specific stuff (mostly just the geocoding and site theme stuff at this point), then release it to the public under the <a href="www.affero.org/oagpl.html">Affero GPL License</a> (was originally going to with GPL, but <a href="http://sfllaw.ca">Simon Law</a> convinced me otherwise&#8230; more on that in a future post).</li>
 <li><strong>Transit To Go</strong> A dedicated iPhone client for the routez software, developed in collaboration with <a href="http://appliedlogic.ca">Dmitri Dolguikh</a> and <a href="http://mindsea.com">Bill Wilson</a>, two talent developers from Halifax. Has some innovative (in my opinion, anyway) details on how things will be viewed. This one&#8217;s going to be proprietary, but will be affordable and awesome.</li></ul>

<p>Besides this, I have a few more irons in the fire&#8230; however, I&#8217;m hesistant to talk about them just yet. Just getting the above done in the midst of my work with <a href="http://navarra.ca">Navarra</a> (to say nothing of having a life in there somewhere) is going to be challenging.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Would be particularly interested in hearing from people working on similar projects to neocoder and routez. Despite how it may some times appear, I don&#8217;t have a NotInventedHere mentality: I&#8217;ve done as an exhaustive survey of the field as I could before deciding to work on my own projects, and what I&#8217;ve found just hasn&#8217;t been the right fit for what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish. However, the world&#8217;s gotten so damn big that I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m missing something&#8230;</p>

<p>So I haven&#8217;t been blogging much lately. Story of my life, I&#8217;ll try to be a bit more active in the new year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now back living in Montr&eacute;al, which has been great. Very sad to leave Halifax and all the <a href="http://thehubhalifax.ca">goings</a> <a href="http://apps4good.ca">on</a>, but I&#8217;ll be back to visit. And I&#8217;m not done with <a href="http://hbus.ca">disruptive transit-related apps</a> for that city. Au contraire. More news on that soon.</p>
