# Housekeeping

Decided it was time to give this site a slight refresh:

- I moved the (mostly Mozilla-related) archives to [archive.wrla.ch]
- Re-wrote the site generation from scratch in Python (the previous version used [Frog], a static site generator written in Racket: neat project, but I wanted something simpler and easier to extend)
- New photo in header, other random odds and ends

I tried to make the transition seamless: RSS feeds, etc. should be in exactly the same format as before.
