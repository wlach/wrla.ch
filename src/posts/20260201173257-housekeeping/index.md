# Housekeeping

Decided it was time to give this site a refresh:

- I moved the (mostly Mozilla-related) archives to [archive.wrla.ch]
- Re-wrote the site generation from scratch in Python (the previous version used [Frog], a static site generator written in Racket: neat project, but I wanted something simpler and easier to extend)
- New photo in header, other random odds and ends

Upshot: hopefully more content from me in 2026, now that I'm not fighting the tooling as much. We'll see!

I tried to make the transition seamless. RSS and Atom feeds should be in exactly the same format and places as before.
Links to old posts should transparently redirect to the appropriate page in the archive.
