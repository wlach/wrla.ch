👋 Hi! My name is Will Lachance and this is my website.
I'm a fortysomething software developer in Toronto, Ontario, Canada currently working at [Voltus] on demand response technology for the electricity grid.

General areas of professional focus include:

- Energy and Control Systems
- Data Engineering
- Developer Productivity Tooling

More broadly, I am interested in open systems, accountability, and helping people achieve their potential.

From 2011-2022, I worked at [Mozilla] (as in [Firefox]) in [Data Engineering] and [Engineering Productivity].

Other random facts:

- I am a nominal Zen Buddhist. I practice at the [Toronto Zen Centre].
- I try to live simply: I use a bicycle for most forms of local transportation and try
  to limit my longer-distance travel to what's strictly necessary.
- I am _mostly_ vegetarian (sometimes I eat mussels, oysters and other invertebrates).
- I prefer they/them pronouns.

I try to be judicious about using social media. That said, you can find me on:

- [mastodon]
- [linkedin]
- [github]
