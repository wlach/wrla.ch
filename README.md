The site is generated by a minimal Python harness which

## Common tasks

- Create a post: `uv run site new-post "Title of post"`
- Build the site: `uv run site build` (writes to `_build`)
- Preview the site: `uv run site preview`

## Maintenance tasks

- Typechecking: `uv run ty check`
- Linting: `uv run ruff check`

## Meta

Initial scaffolding (project layout, CLI entrypoint, templates, and build pipeline) was generated with OpenAI's Codex (GPT-5) and then reviewed/edited by the author, based on an [implementation decision record](https://github.com/wlach/idr-tools) defined in [idrs/202602010059-reboot-in-python.md](idrs/202602010059-reboot-in-python.md).

All written content is original work by the author, although various LLMs may have been used in the editing process.
